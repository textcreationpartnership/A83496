         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe knowledge I had of the de≈øires of my Scotti≈øh Subjects, was the cau≈øe of my calling the la≈øt A≈ø≈øembly of Parliament, wherein had I beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved; I ≈øincerely thinke, that things had not fallen out as now we ≈øee: But it is no wonder that men are ≈øo ≈ølow to beleeve that ≈øo great a ≈øedition ≈øhould be rai≈øed on ≈øo little ground. But now my Lords, and Gentlemen, the honour and ≈øafety of this Kingdome lying ≈øo neerely at the ≈øtake; I am re≈øolved to put my ≈øelf freely and cleerly on the love and affections of my Engli≈øh Subjects, as the≈øe of my Lords that did wait on me at <hi>York,</hi> very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I there declared. Therefore my Lords, I ≈øhall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mine own intere≈øt, or that ≈øupport I might ju≈øtly expect from you, till the common ≈øafety be ≈øecured; though I mu≈øt tell you I am not a≈øhamed to ≈øay, tho≈øe charges I have been at, have been meerly for the ≈øecuring and good of this Kingdome, though the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe hath not been an≈øwerable to my de≈øires. Therefore I ≈øhall only de≈øire you to con≈øider the be≈øt way both for the ≈øafety and ≈øecurity of this Kingdome, wherein their are two parts chiefly con≈øiderable. Fir≈øt, the cha≈øtifing out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells. And ≈øecondly, that other, in ≈øatisfying your ju≈øt grievances, wherein I ≈øhall promi≈øe you to concurre ≈øo

Now my Lords, and Gentlemen, I leave it to your con≈øiderations, what di≈øhonour and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe it might be, in ca≈øe for want of money my Armie be disbanded, before the Rebells be put out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Secondly, the ≈øecuring the calamities the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern people endure at this time, and ≈øo long as the treaty is on foot. And in this I may ≈øay not only they, but all this Kingdome will ≈øuffer the harme; therefore I leave this al≈øo to your con≈øideration, for the ordering of the≈øe great affairs whereof you are to treat at this time.

I told you the Rebells mu≈øt be put out of this Kingdome; it's true, I mu≈øt needs call them ≈øo, ≈øo long as they have an Armie that do invade us; and although I am under treaty with them, and I under my great Seale do call them Subjects, and ≈øo they are too, but the ≈øtate of my Affairs in ≈øhort is this. It's true, I did expect when I did will my Lords and great ones at <hi>Yorke,</hi> to have given a gracious an≈øwer to all your grievances; for I was in good hope by their wi≈øedomes and a≈ø≈øi≈øtances to have made an end of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, but I mu≈øt tell you that my Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ≈øo delay them, that it was not po≈ø≈øible to end there: Therefore I can no wayes blame my Lords that were at <hi>Rippon,</hi> that the treaty was not ended, but mu≈øt thanke them for their pains and indu≈øtry, and certainly had they as much power as affections, I ≈øhould by that time have brought the≈øe di≈øtempers to a happy period; ≈øo that now the treaty is tran≈øported from <hi>Rippon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where I ≈øhall conclude nothing without your knowledge, and I doubt not but by your approbation; for I do not de≈øire to have this great work done in a corner, for I ≈øhall lay
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156910:7"/>open all the ≈øteps of this mi≈ø-under≈øtanding, and cau≈øes of the great differences between Me and my Subjects of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And I doubt not but by your a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to make them know their duty, and al≈øo by your a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to make them return whether they will or no.</p>

                  <salute>My Lords,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THe Knights, Citizens, Burge≈ø≈øes; The principall cau≈øe of my comming here at this time, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the ≈ølow proceedings in Parliament, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is a great deale of inconvenience.</p>
               <p>Therefore I think it very nece≈ø≈øary to lay before you the ≈øtate of my affairs as now they ≈øtand, therby to ha≈øten (not interrupt) your proceedings.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, I mu≈øt remember you that there are two Armies in the Kingdome, in a manner maintained by you, the very naming of which, doth more cleerly ≈øhew the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience thereof, then a better tongue then mine can expre≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Therfore in the fir≈øt place, I ≈øhall recommend unto you the quick di≈øpatch of that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, a≈ø≈øuring you that it cannot re≈øt upon me.</p>
               <p>In the next place I mu≈øt recommend unto you the State of my Navie and Forts; the condition of both which is ≈øo well known unto you, that I need not tell you the particulars, only thus much; they are the Walls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this Kingdome, which if out of order, all men may ea≈øily judge what incouragement it will be to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156910:7"/>Our enemies, and what di≈øheartning to our friends.</p>
               <p>La≈øt of all, (and not of the lea≈øt to be con≈øidered) I mu≈øt lay before you the di≈øtractions that are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent occa≈øioned through the cau≈øe of Parliament; for there are ≈øome men that more maliciou≈øly than ignorantly, will put no difference betweene Reformation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of government.</p>
               <p>Hence it commech that divine Service is irreverently interrupted, and Petitions in an ill way given in, neither di≈øputed nor denied. But I will enter into no more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but ≈øhew you a way of remedie, by ≈øhewing you my cleer intentions, and ≈øome marke that may hinder this good worke.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall willingly and cheerfully concur with you for the Reformation of all Innovations both in Church, and Common-wealth, and con≈øequently that all Courts of Ju≈øtice may be reformed according to Law. For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions is cleerly to reduce all things to the be≈øt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt times as they were in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, what≈øoever part of my Revenue ≈øhall be found illegall or heavy to my Subjects, I ≈øhall be willing to lay down, tru≈øting in their affections. Having thus cleerly and ≈øhortly ≈øet down my intentions, I will ≈øhew you ≈øome rubs, and mu≈øt needs take notice of ≈øome very ≈øtrange (I know not what terme to give them) Petitions given in the name of divers Counties, again≈øt the e≈øtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed government of the Church, and of the great threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings again≈øt the Bi≈øhops, that they will make them to be but a Cipher, or at lea≈øt taken away.</p>
               <p>If ≈øome of them have incroached too much upon the Temporaltie (if it be ≈øo) I ≈øhall not be unwilling the≈øe things ≈øhould be redre≈ø≈øed and reformed, as all other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øes according to the wi≈ødome of former times; ≈øo farre I ≈øhall go with you, no farther.</p>
               <p>If upon ≈øerious debate you ≈øhall ≈øhew that Bi≈øhops have ≈øome Temporall Authority, not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156910:8"/>of the Church, and upholding Epi≈øcopall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction; I ≈øhall not be unwilling to de≈øire them to lay it down, but this mu≈øt not be under≈øtood, that I ≈øhall any way con≈øent that their voice in Parliament ≈øhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; for in all the times of my Predece≈ø≈øors ≈øince the Conque≈øt, and before, they have enjoyed it; I am bound to maintain them in i, as one of the fundamentall In≈øtitutions of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>There is one other Rock you are on, not in ≈øub≈øtance, but in ≈øervice; and the forme is ≈øo e≈ø≈øentiall, that unle≈ø≈øe it be reformed, will ≈øplit you on that Rock.</p>
               <p>There is a Bill lately put in concerning Parliaments. The thing I like well to have frequent Parliaments, but for Sheriffes and Con≈øtables to u≈øe my Authoritie, I can no wayes con≈øent unto.</p>
               <p>But to ≈øhew that I de≈øire to give you content in ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance as well as in ≈øhew, that you ≈øhall have a Bill for doing thereof, ≈øo that it do not trench neither again≈øt my Honor, neither again≈øt the ancient Prerogatives of the Crowns concerning Parliaments, Ingeniou≈øly confe≈ø≈øe, often Parliaments is the fitte≈øt means to keep corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie betweene Me and my People, that I doe ≈øo much de≈øire.</p>
               <p>To conclude, now all that I have ≈øhewen you, the ≈øtate of my Affairs, My own cleere intentions, and the Rocks I would have you ≈øhun.</p>
               <p>To give you all contentment, you ≈øhall likewi≈øe finde by the≈øe Mini≈øters, I have, or ≈øhall have, about me for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the≈øe my good intentions, which ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double the peace of the Kingdome, and content you all.

               <p>For His ju≈øt and pious Government, I dare boldly ≈øay that if any under Him as our In≈øtrument, have had the di≈øtributing of ju≈øtice to His people, have not done as they ought, the fault is their own, and they have done

I know not under what pretence, but all that time they came very neer <hi>England,</hi> with an Army ≈øo neer that it was believed, they would have then entred and invaded the Kingdome. They did profe≈ø≈øe the contrary, neither did they want remon≈øtrations, and declarations, to infu≈øe this opinion into the hearts of His Maje≈øties people, before it would by the effects. What their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions from the beginning were, His Maie≈øtie by His goodne≈ø≈øe and wi≈øedome, ≈øettled a Peace, and made a pacification at <hi>Barwick,</hi> upon which both Armies were disbanded, which pacification, and every Article of it, His Maie≈øty for His part hath been ≈øo far from violating, that when≈øoever any que≈øtion ≈øhall be made of it, ≈øhall plainly and clearly appear, it was His care to ≈øee it in all things performed. On the contrary, tho≈øe Subiects of His not contented with that grace, which His Maie≈øty then gave them in tho≈øe Articles of pacification, they have ≈øtrained them beyond the bounds and limits of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and meaning; but they over and above attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and acted divers things ≈øo prejudiciall to Monarchy, and contrary, and repugnant to the Law, and ≈øettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, and u≈øage of that Kingdome, that His Maie≈øty could not in honour continue at it.</p>
               <p>This being made known unto His Maie≈øty, and to His Privy Councell, by tho≈øe who be≈øt knew the State, and affairs of that Kingdom, and that were mo≈øt tru≈øted and imployed by His Maie≈øty. His Maie≈øty by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous

               <p>His Maie≈øty then fore≈øaw and foretold, that the rai≈øing of an Army at this time, was but to ≈øtand upon their own defence, as they profe≈ø≈øed, and they had an intention to enter this Kingdome, and to ≈øeize upon ≈øome place of importance, and eminency, and His Maie≈øty in particular named <hi>Newca≈øtle.</hi>

               <p>That was not done to prevent, but to prepare for a Parliament.</p>
               <p>It was not to cla≈øh, or entor fire with this a≈ø≈øembly, by acting or ordering any thing which belongeth to this high and ≈øupream juri≈ødiction, but onely to give their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance for the pre≈øent, to render things more fit for this great a≈ø≈øembly;</p>
               <p>That His Maie≈øties intention was ≈øo, it is cleer, for before ever any petition was delivered, or ever any ≈øpeech of petition for a Parliament, His Maie≈øty had re≈øolved to call one.</p>

               <p>The next thing His Maie≈øty conceived, And all that were there, were of one opinion, with one voyce, and con≈øent, that it was not fit His Maie≈øty ≈øhould disband His Army, ≈øo long as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was on foot; And His Maie≈øty wi≈øhed them to take into their con≈øideration what way to have maintenance, for His Army in the mean time.</p>

               <p>My Lords, how≈øoever they had received this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and explanation upon every particular of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, yet in ju≈øtice they thought it was fit to hear what could be ≈øaid, on the other ≈øide, how the objection might be an≈øwered, and what objection might be made by them again≈øt that which ≈øeemed to be plain enough.</p>
               <p>For this purpo≈øe they were all of opinion, and his Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to be of the ≈øame opinion, that ≈øome Lords ≈øelected and tru≈øted by that great Councell, ≈øhould Treate with tho≈øe Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon all tho≈øe particulars, to the end that they might ≈øee what they did cleerly intend; to the end that if a firm peace which was mo≈øt de≈øired from us might be had, or a ju≈øt Warre to be begun.</p>
               <p>My Lords of the great Councell that were appointed for that purpo≈øe, were the Earles of <hi>Bedford, Hertford, E≈ø≈øex, Salisbury, Warwick, Bri≈øtow, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Barke≈øhire,</hi> The Barons were the Lords, <hi>Wharton, Paget, Rimbolton, Brooke, Pawlet, Howard</hi> of <hi>E≈øaich, Savile,</hi> and <hi>Dun≈ømore.</hi>

               <p>After which choice, ≈øome generall in≈øurrections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the debate and di≈øcour≈øes in that great Councell, a Commi≈ø≈øion under the great Seale was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, to enable them to treate and conclude as they in their wi≈øedomes and Judgements ≈øhould thinke fit. The place appointed for this treaty was at <hi>Rippon,</hi> where the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners wanted the happine≈ø≈øe of that, that they, and we had at <hi>Yorke,</hi> of his Maie≈øties pre≈øence. And that might be the occa≈øion that more time was ≈øpent in it, then otherwi≈øe would have been; yet my Lords omitted not their parts, but were de≈øirous to look into the depth, to ≈øee the utmo≈øt extent of their demands.</p>
               <p>But before tho≈øe of <hi>Scotland</hi> could come to the maine treaty, to explaine them≈øelves touching their demands, they made a preparatory demand of maintenance for their Armie, and did go ≈øo high, as to demand Forty thou≈øand Pounds a moneth. My Lords (that were very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>Nay, their Lords were ≈øatisfied that the County of <hi>Yorke</hi> was in danger, and that not to be prevented but by a battell, if the <hi>Scots</hi> came on with an Armie, and my Lords were loath, where there were ≈øuch ods, ≈øo many twenties to one, that a battell ≈øhould be adventured And if the County of <hi>Yorke</hi> ≈øhould be in danger, we might quickly fore≈øee how the danger might run over the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And my Lords, as well as tho≈øe that remained at <hi>Yorke,</hi> as tho≈øe at <hi>Rippon,</hi> having received complaints from the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Durbam</hi> (<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Newca≈øtle</hi>) and the Maior of <hi>Newca≈øtle</hi> being impri≈øoned, and ≈øome of his Brethren, as was repre≈øented unto them, kept without fire or candle, and of divers wa≈øtes and ≈øpoyles done in the Countrey. My Lords did thinke fit, that ≈øince the Counties of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Bi≈øhoprick of <hi>Durbam,</hi> and <hi>Newca≈øtle</hi> had already made a compo≈øition and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they would at la≈øt ratifie and confirm the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition and agreement, ≈øo as there might be a ce≈ø≈øation of Arms, and acts of ho≈øtility; and that they which had fled from their dwellings in tho≈øe Counties might returne in

My Lords for the≈øe rea≈øons thought it fit for the pre≈øent to give way unto them, rather than to bazard ≈øo great calamitie and affliction that would have fallen on tho≈øe Counties; hereupon they did conclude for 850. pound by day, and this to continue for two moneths, if the treaty before tooke not effect, the two Moneths to begin from the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> then they took Articles for ce≈ø≈øation of Arms.

               <p>But ≈øince ≈øuch excellent Members of our Hou≈øe, thought fit the other day to lay a≈øide that Caution, and to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their ≈øoules ≈øo freely in the way of zeale to his Maje≈øties ≈øervice, and their Countries good: I ≈øhall interpret that confidence of theirs for a lucky Omen to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and with your permi≈ø≈øion licence my thoughts too, a little.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speak r,</hi> under tho≈øe heads which I propo≈øed to you, as the grievances of <hi>Dor≈øet≈øhire,</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe are compri≈øed the greate≈øt part of the mi≈øchiefs which have of late years layed battery either to our E≈øtates or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences.</p>
               <p>Sir, I doe not conceive this the fit ≈øea≈øon to ≈øearch and ventilate particulars, yet I profe≈ø≈øe I cannot forbear to adde ≈øomewhat, to what was ≈øaid the la≈øt day by a learned Gentleman of the long Robe, concerning the acts of that reverend new <hi>Synod,</hi> made of an old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. Doth not every <hi>Parliament</hi> mans heart ri≈øe to ≈øee the Prelats thus u≈øurpe to them≈øelves the Grand Preeminence of <hi>Parliament?</hi> The granting of Sub≈øidies, &amp; that under ≈øo prepo≈øterous a name as of a <hi>Benevolence,</hi> for that which is a <hi>Malevolence</hi> indeed; A <hi>Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> I am confident in tho≈øe that granted it, again≈øt <hi>Parliaments:</hi> and a <hi>Malevolence</hi> ≈øurely in tho≈øe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe it, again≈øt tho≈øe that granted it, for how can it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite le≈ø≈øe? when they ≈øee wre≈øted from them what they are not willing to part with, under no le≈ø≈øe a penalty then the lo≈ø≈øe both of Heaven and Earth: of Heaven, by excommunication; and of the Earth By Deprivation; &amp; this without Redemption by appeal. What good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian can think with patience on ≈øuch an in≈ønaring Oath, as that which is by the new Canons enjoyned to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by all Mini≈øters, Lawyers, Phy≈øitians, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates in the Vniver≈øities? where, be≈øides the ≈øwearing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156910:21"/>≈øuch an impertinence, as that things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are contained in Di≈øcipline; be≈øides the ≈øwearing tho≈øe to be of Divine right, which among≈øt the learned, never pretended to it, as the Arch things in our Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy. Be≈øides, the ≈øwearing not to con≈øent to the change of that, which the State may upon great rea≈øon thinke fit to alter: Be≈øides the bottomele≈ø≈øe perjury of an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be≈øides all this, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> men mu≈øt ≈øweare that they ≈øweare freely and voluntarily what they are compelled unto: and la≈øtly, that they ≈øweare that Oath in the literall ≈øence, whereof no two of the makers them≈øelves, that I have heard of, could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the under≈øtanding.</p>
               <p>In a word, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to tell you my opinion of this Oath, it is a Covenant again≈øt the King, for Bi≈øhops and the Hierarchy; as the Scotti≈øh Covenants is again≈øt them, onely ≈øo much wor≈øe then the Scotti≈øh, as they admit not of the Supremacy in Eccle≈øia≈øticall affaires, and we are ≈øworne unto it.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> for tho≈øe particular heads of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances whereby our E≈øtates and Properties are ≈øo radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally invaded; I ≈øuppo≈øe (as I ≈øayd before) that it is no ≈øea≈øon now to enter into a ≈øtrict Di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of them; onely thus much I ≈øhall ≈øay of them, with application to the Countrey for which I ≈øerve, that none can more ju≈øtly complaine, ≈øince none can more ju≈øtly challenge exemption from ≈øuch burdens then <hi>Dor≈øet ≈øhire;</hi> whether you con≈øider its a Countrey ≈øub≈øi≈øting much by Trade; or as none of the mo≈øt populous; or as expo≈øed as much as any to Forraigne Inva≈øion.</p>
               <p>But alas Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> particular lamentations are hardly di≈øtingui≈øhable in Vniver≈øall groanes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it hath beene a Metaphor frequent in <hi>Parlamant,</hi> and if my memory fayle me not, was made u≈øe of in the Lord <hi>Keepers</hi> Speech at the opening of the la≈øt, that what mony Kings ray≈øed from their <hi>Subjects,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:156910:22"/>they were <hi>But as <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>apors drawn up from the Earth by the Sunne, to bee di≈øtilled upon it againe in fructifying ≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.</hi> The Compari≈øon Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> hath held of late yeares in this Kingdome too unluckily: what hath bin rai≈øed from the Subject by tho≈øe violent attractions, hath beene formed, it is true, into Clouds, but how? to darken the Sunnes owne lu≈øtre, and hath fallen againe upon the Land only in Hail-≈øtones and Mildews, to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and pro≈øt rate ≈øtill more and more our liberties, to bla≈øt and wither our affections; had the latter of the≈øe beene ≈øtill kept alive by our Kings owne per≈øonall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which wil ever pre≈øerve him in ≈øpight of all ill Coun≈øellours, a ≈øacred object, both of our admiration and loves.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It hath beene often ≈øayd in this Hou≈øe, and I thinke can never be too often repeated, <hi>That the Kings of England can do no wrong;</hi> but thogh they could Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> yet Princes have no part in the ill of tho≈øe actions which their Judges a≈ø≈øure them to be ju≈øt, their Coun≈øellours that they are prudent, and their Divines that they are con≈øcientious.</p>
               <p>This Con≈øideration, M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> leadeth mee to that which is more nece≈ø≈øary farre, at this ≈øea≈øon, than any farther laying open of our mi≈øeries, that is, the way to the remedy, by ≈øeeking to remove from our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> ≈øuch unju≈øt Judges, ≈øuch pernicious Coun≈øellours, and ≈øuch di≈øcon≈øcient Divines, as have of late yeares, by their wicked practi≈øes, provoked a≈øper≈øions upon the government of the graciou≈øe≈øt and be≈øt of Kings.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let me not be mi≈ø-under≈øtood, I levell at no man with a fore-layd de≈øigne, let the faults, and and tho≈øe well proved, lead us to the men: It is the onely true <hi>Parliamentary</hi> method, and the onely fit one to incline our <hi>Soveraigne.</hi> For it can no more

                  <hi>The Humours that I under≈øtand to have cau≈øed all the de≈øperate maladies of this Nation, are the ill Mini≈øter. To purge them away clearely, they mu≈øt be fir≈øt loo≈øened, un≈øetled, and extenuated, which can no way bee effected with a gracious Ma≈øter, but by truely repre≈øenting them unworthy of his protection. And this leadeth mee to my Motion, which is; that a ≈øelect Committee may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to draw out of all that hath beene heere repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ≈øuch a Remon≈øtrance as may be a faithfull and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation unto his Maje≈øty of the deplorable e≈øtate of this his Kingdome, and ≈øuch as may happily point out unto his cleare and excellent judgment, the pernicious Authors of it. And that this</hi> Remon≈øtrance <hi>being drawne, wee may with all ≈øpeed repaire to the Lords, and de≈øire them to joyne with with us in it:</hi> And this is my humble motion.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Ri≈øe not now with an intent to ≈øpeake to the frame and ≈øtructure of this Bill, nor much by way of an≈øwer to objections that may be made; I hope there will be no occa≈øion of that, but that we ≈øhall concurre all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimou≈øly in what concerneth all ≈øo Univer≈øally.</p>
               <p>Onely Sir, by way of preparation, to the end that we may not be di≈øcouraged in this great worke by difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may appeare in the way of it, I ≈øhall deliver unto you my apprehen≈øions in generall of the va≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and nece≈ø≈øity that wee ≈øhould goe thorow with it.</p>
               <p>The Re≈øult of my ≈øen≈øe is in ≈øhort this: That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øse for the frequent convening of <hi>Parliaments</hi> there be ≈øome ≈øuch cour≈øe ≈øetled, as may not be eluded; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156910:23"/>the people can be pro≈øperous and ≈øecure, not the King him≈øelfe ≈øolidly happy. I take this to be the <hi>Vnum nece≈ø≈øarium:</hi> Let us procure this, and all our other de≈øires will effect them≈øelves: if this bill mi≈øcarry, I ≈øhall have left me no publike hopes, and once pa≈øt, I ≈øhall be freed of all publike feares.</p>
               <p>The e≈ø≈øentialne≈ø≈øe Sir of frequent <hi>Parliaments</hi> to the happine≈ø≈øe of this Kingdome, might be inferr'd unto you by the rea≈øon of contraries, from the wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which former times have had of the mi≈øchievous effects of any long intermi≈ø≈øion of them.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> why ≈øhould we clime higher then the levell we are on, or thinke further then our owne Horizon, or have recour≈øe for examples in this bu≈øines, to any other promptuary then our owne memories; nay then the experience almo≈øt of the younge≈øt here?</p>
               <p>The reflection backward on the di≈øtractions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times upon intermi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the con≈øideration forward of the mi≈øchiefes likely ≈øtill to grow from the ≈øame cau≈øe if not remooved, doubtle≈øly gave fir≈øt life and being to tho≈øe two dormant Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, for the yearly holding of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And ≈øhall not the fre≈øh and bleeding experience in the pre≈øent age of mi≈øeries from the ≈øame ≈øpring, not to be paralleld in any other, obtaine a wakening, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection for them?</p>
               <p>The Inte≈øtine di≈øtempers Sir, of former ages upon the want of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> may appeare to have had ≈øome other cooperative cau≈øes, as ≈øometimes, un≈øucce≈ø≈øefull Warres abroad; ≈øometimes, the ab≈øence of the Prince; ≈øometimes, Competitions of Titles to the Crowne; ≈øomtimes, perhaps the vices of the King him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>But let us but rightly weigh and con≈øider the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture, the a≈øpect of this ≈øtate, both toward it ≈øelfe, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156910:24"/>the re≈øt of the world, the per≈øon of our Soveraigne, and the nature of our ≈øuffering ≈øince the third of his Reigne. And there can be no cau≈øe coulorable inventible, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to attribute them but the intermi≈ø≈øion, or which is wor≈øe, the undue fru≈øtration of <hi>Parliament,</hi> by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckly u≈øe if not abu≈øe of Prerogative in the di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them.</p>
               <p>Take in your view Gentlemen, a State in a ≈øtate of the greate≈øt quiet and ≈øecurity that can be fancied, not only in joyning the calme≈øt peace it ≈øelfe, but to improve and ≈øecure its happy condition, all the re≈øt of the world at the ≈øame time in Tempe≈øt, in Combu≈øtions, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compo≈øable Warres.</p>
               <p>Take into your view Sir, a King Soveraigne to three Kingdomes, by a Concentring of all the Royall lines in his Per≈øon, as undi≈øputably as any Mathematical ones in <hi>Euclide.</hi> A King firme and knowing in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eminent in vertue; A King that had in his owne time given all the Rights and Liberties of his Subjects a more cleare and ample confirmation freely and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly, then any of his Predece≈ø≈øors (when the people had them at advantage) extortedly, I meane in the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right.</hi>

               <p>This is one Mappe of <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> A man Sir, that ≈øhould pre≈øent unto you now, a Kingdome, groaning under that ≈øupreme Law, which <hi>Salus populi periclitata</hi> would enact. The liberty, the property of the Subject fundamentally ≈øubverted, ravi≈øht away by the violence of a pretended nece≈ø≈øity; a triple Crown ≈øhaking with di≈øtempers; men of the be≈øt con≈øcience rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fly into the wilderne≈ø≈øe for Religion. Would not one ≈øweare that this were the Antipodes to the other; &amp; yet let me tell you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> this is a Mappe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> too, and both at the ≈øame time true.</p>

               <p>As it cannot bee denyed, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that ≈øince the Conque≈øt there hath not been in this Kingdome a fuller concurrance of all circum≈øtances in the former Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, to have made a Kingdom happy, then for the≈øe 12. yeares la≈øt pa≈øt; ≈øo it is mo≈øt certaine, that there hath not beene in all that deduction of ages, ≈øuch a Con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, if one may ≈øo ≈øay of all the Elements of mi≈øchiefe thein ≈øecond Character, to bring a flouri≈øhing Kingdom, if it were po≈ø≈øible, to ≈øwift ruine and de≈øolation.</p>
               <p>I will be bold to ≈øay, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> and I thanke <hi>God,</hi> wee have ≈øo good a King, under whom wee may ≈øpeake boldly of the abu≈øe by ill Mini≈øters, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his per≈øon.</p>
               <p>That an Accumulation of all the publike Grievances ≈øince <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> one upon another, unto that houre in which the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> pa≈øt into an act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> would not amount to ≈øo oppre≈ø≈øive; I am ≈øure not to ≈øo de≈øtructive a height and magnitude to the rights and property of the Subject, as one branch of our be≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øince the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The branch I mean, is the judgment concerning ≈øhip-money. This beeing a true repre≈øentation of <hi>England</hi> in both a≈øpects.</p>
               <p>Let him, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that for the unmatcht oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enthralling of free Subjects in a time of the be≈øt Kings raigne, and in memory of the be≈øt lawes enacted in favour of Subjects liberty, can find a truer Cau≈øe then the ruptures and intermi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Let him and him alone be again≈øt the ≈øetling of this inevitable way for the frequent holding of them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true Sir, wicked Mini≈øters have beene the prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156910:25"/>cau≈øes of our mi≈øeries, but the want of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> the primary, the efficient Cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>Ill Mini≈øters have made ill times, but that Sir, hath made ill Mini≈øters.</p>
               <p>I have read among the Lawes of the Athenians, a form of recour≈øe in their Oaths and vows of greate≈øt &amp; mo≈øt publique concernment of a three-fold Deity, <hi>Supplicium Exauditori, Purgatori, Malorum depul≈øori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but we here a≈ø≈øembled for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ≈øhall meet with all the≈øe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in our Soveraigne.</p>
               <p>I make no que≈øtion but he will graciou≈øly heare our Supplications, purge away our Grievances, and expell Malefactors, that is, remove ill Mini≈øters, and put good in their places.</p>
               <p>No le≈ø≈øe can be expected from his wi≈ødome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if we partake not of one Attribute more in him; if we addre≈ø≈øe not our ≈øelves unto that, I meane <hi>Bonorum Con≈øervatori;</hi> we can have no ≈øolid, no durable Comfort in all the re≈øt.</p>
               <p>Let his Maje≈øty heare our Complaint never ≈øo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionately.</p>
               <p>Let him purge away our Grievances never ≈øo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou≈øly.</p>
               <p>Let him puni≈øh and di≈øpell ill Mini≈øters never ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily.</p>

               <p>Let him make choyce of good ones never ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.</p>
               <p>If there be not a way ≈øetled to pre≈øerve and keepe them good; the mi≈øchiefes and they will all grow again like <hi>Samp≈øons</hi> Locks, and pull downe the Hou≈øe upon our heads. Beleeve it M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they will.</p>
               <p>It hath been a Maxime among≈øt the wi≈øe≈øt Legi≈ølators, that who≈øoever meanes to ≈øettle good Lawes, mu≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in them, with a ≈øini≈øter opinion of all Mankinde; and ≈øuppo≈øe that who≈øoever is not wicked, it is for want only of the opportunity. It is that opportunity of being ill Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that wee mu≈øt take away, if ever wee meane to be happy, which can never be done, but by the frequencie of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ≈øtate can wi≈øely be confident of any publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters continuing good, longer then the rod is over him.</p>
               <p>Let me appeale to all tho≈øe that were pre≈øent in this Hou≈øe at the agitation of the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right.</hi> And let them tell them≈øelves truly, of who≈øe promotion to the management of affaires doe they thinke the generality would at that time have had better hopes then of Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> both having beene at that time, and in that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe as I have heard, mo≈øt keen and active Patriots, and the latter of them to the eternall aggravation of his Infamous treachery to the Common-wealth be it ≈øpoken, the fir≈øt mover, and in≈øi≈øter to have this clau≈øe added to the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> that for the comfort and ≈øafety of his Subjects, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty would be plea≈øed to declare his will and plea≈øure, that all his Mini≈øters ≈øhould ≈øerve him according to the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:156910:26"/>
               <p>And yet Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to whom now can all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations upon our liberties under pretence of Law, and the late ≈øhipwrack at once of all our property, be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted more then to <hi>Noy,</hi> and tho≈øe and all other mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes whereby this Monarchie hath beene brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt to the brinke of de≈øtruction, ≈øo much to any as to that Grand Apo≈øtate to the Common-wealth, the now Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               </p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO things have fallen into debate this day.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt, concerning the <hi>Londoners</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, whether it ≈øhould bee committed or no.</p>
               <p>The other, concerning the government of the Church, by Arch-bi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, &amp;c. whether it ≈øhould bee countenanced or no.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt, I doe not under≈øtand by any thing that I have yet heard, why the <hi>Londoners</hi> Petition ≈øhould not be committed, or countenanced.</p>
               <p>The exceptions that are taken again≈øt it, are from the irregularities of the delivery of it, and from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter contained in it.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt, it is alledged that the long taile of this blazing ≈øtarre, is ominous, and that ≈øuch a number of Petitioners, and ≈øuch a number that brought the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Hou≈øe, was irregular. Hereunto I an≈øwer, that the fault was either in the multitude of the Petitioners, or in their carriages, and demeanours: if a multitude
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156910:29"/>finde them≈øelves agrieved, why it ≈øhould be a fault in them to expre≈ø≈øe their grievances more than in one, or a few, I cannot ≈øee; nay, to me it ≈øeemes rather a rea≈øon that their Petitions ≈øhould be committed, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øerious con≈øideration, for thereby they may receive ≈øatisfaction, though all bee not granted that they de≈øire. But if wee ≈øhall throw their Petition behind the door, and refu≈øe to con≈øider it, that it may ≈øeeme an act of will in us. And whether an act of will in us, may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an act of will in the people, I leave it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration. Sure I am, acts of will are more dangerous there than here, becau≈øe u≈øually they are more tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. All Lawes are made, principally for the quiet and peace of a Kingdome; and a Law may be of ≈øuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature many times, that it is a good rea≈øon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, onely, becau≈øe a great number de≈øires it, if there were nothing el≈øe in it, and therefore I doe not ≈øee that the number of Petitioners is any good rea≈øon, why it ≈øhould not bee committed, but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now for their carriage, there came indeed, three or foure hundred of the 15000, ≈øome of the better ≈øort of them, and there might bee good rea≈øon for it. I have heard that there was brought a Petition to ≈øome privie Coun≈øellours, with a thou≈øand hands to it, and being brought onely with ≈øixe men, they were an≈øwered, that they ≈øixe might write tho≈øe thou≈øand hands; if there were a thou≈øand that joyned in the Petition, why did they not come too? And we heard it objected but the other day, in this hou≈øe again≈øt the Mini≈øters Petition, that there were indeed ≈øeven or eight hundred names to it, but two hands onely. Therefore it was not without cau≈øe, that a con≈øiderable number ≈øhould come with a Petition ≈øigned by ≈øo many; but for any di≈øorder in their carriage, I ≈øaw none; for upon an intimation in one word from this hou≈øe, they forthwith retired to their dwellings. As for the ≈øubject matter of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156910:30"/>three exceptions are taken again≈øt it.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that divers things are contemptible in it, as that about <hi>Ovid de Amore,</hi> ≈øet forth in Engli≈øh, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuch things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in many things their di≈øcour≈øe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together irrationall, for that they argue from per≈øonall faults of Bi≈øhops again≈øt the office it ≈øelfe of Bi≈øhops, and in other things argue from effects that proceed from it by accident, as if they did flie out of it.</p>
               <p>And in the la≈øt place, that their prayer and conclu≈øion is bold and pre≈øumptuous, de≈øiring ≈øo boldly an aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ≈øtanding Lawes.</p>
               <p>To the fir≈øt I an≈øwer, that ≈øome things may ≈øeeme contemptible in them≈øelves, which are not ≈øo in their cau≈øes, nor in their effects, as the ≈øuffering of ≈øuch la≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious pamphlets to be printed and publi≈øhed, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable writings are ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, doth di≈øcover a principle, that loo≈øene≈ø≈øe and prophane≈ø≈øe (which will helpe to bring in ≈øuper≈øtition) is more ≈øutable to their hierarchy than the contrary, which makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at ≈øuch things as are apt to produce loo≈øene≈ø≈øe and lewdne≈ø≈øe, and this is no contemptible effect, nor doth it proceed from a contemptible cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>In the next place, for that which ≈øeemes irrationall in the way of their di≈øcovery, divers things may ≈øeeme to bee per≈øonall faults, which indeed are derived unto the per≈øons from the office, or from the circum≈øtances thereof, I meane their revenues, and dignities on the one ≈øide, and the ceremonies on the other ≈øide. For mo≈øt of the things complained of, as ≈øilencing, and thru≈øting out of godly and painfull Preachers, bringing in Innovations in Doctrine, and wor≈øhip, and the like; although they may ≈øeeme per≈øonall and accidentall faults, yet if wee follow them to their la≈øt re≈øort, wee ≈øhall find that their worldly wealth and dignities ≈øtirre them up to doe this, that their ≈øole and arbitrary power
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156910:30"/>over the Clergy, and in matter Eccle≈øia≈øticall, enable them to effect it, and the ceremonies both new and old ≈øerve as in≈øtruments, and meanes, whereby they effect it.</p>
               <p>In the la≈øt place, that their Prayer in the conclu≈øion of their Petition, is bold or pre≈øumptuous, I doe not ≈øee there is any rea≈øon ≈øo to e≈øteeme of it: for if they had taken upon them to have altered any thing upon their owne authority, or had imperiou≈øly required the <hi>Parliament</hi> to doe it, then it might de≈øerve ≈øuch a ≈øtile: but when they come as humble ≈øuppliants, by way of Petition, de≈øiring the altering of Lawes, that have been found burden≈øome unto them, and that of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where, and wherein onely old lawes may bee repealed, and new Lawes may be made, they come in the right manner, to their right and proper place, and therefore have done nothing boldly, or pre≈øumptuou≈øly, but orderly, and regularly, and therefore ought not to receive any check or di≈øcouragement in the way that they have taken.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, concerning the government of the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Arch-Bi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, &amp;c.</hi> which al≈øo hath beene ≈øpoken unto; whereas it is de≈øired, that the evills, and inconveniences ≈øhould be ≈øhewed which ari≈øe not from the per≈øons, but from the office it ≈øelfe of Bi≈øhops, I ≈øhall apply my di≈øcour≈øe particularly to that poynt. But fir≈øt, I ≈øhall crave leave to ≈øay a word or two, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to what hath beene alledged for the credit of the Government by Bi≈øhops. Fir≈øt, that it is as ancient as Chri≈øtian Religion, and that it hath continued ever ≈øince the time of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles; as for this, I doe not pretend to have ≈øo much knowledge in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as to confute this out of the Fathers and Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall Hi≈øtories; (although there are that undertake that) onely one ≈øentence I have often heard cited out of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that in the Primitive times, <hi>Omnia
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156910:31"/>communi Clericorum Concilio regebantur:</hi> and truely ≈øo farre as the Acts of the Apo≈øtles, and the New Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goeth, which was the anciente≈øt, and mo≈øt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive time of Chri≈øtianity, I could never find there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny di≈øtinction betweene a Bi≈øhop and a Presbyter, but that they were one and the very ≈øame thing. In the next place, that which is alledged for the credit of Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, is, <hi>that our Reformers and Martyrs were many of them Bi≈øhops, and practi≈øed many of tho≈øe things now complai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed of; and that in other Reformed Churches wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>re Bi≈øhops are not, they are de≈øired.</hi> For the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Church that were Bi≈øhops, I doe not under≈øtand that that was any part of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nor of their Martyrdome; I have read, that whereas <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> had ≈øome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them in their life time about the≈øe things, when they came both to their <hi>martyrdome,</hi> he that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beene the Patron of this <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> told his brother, <hi>that therein his fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe had conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his wi≈øedome.</hi> As for that which is ≈øaid, <hi>that other Reformed Churches where they have not Bi≈øhops, yet they are de≈øired,</hi> I will not deny but ≈øome among them may de≈øire <hi>Bi≈øhopricks,</hi> I meane the <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> of Bi≈øhops, but that they de≈øire Bi≈øhops as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it the fitte≈øt and be≈øt <hi>Government</hi> of the Church, I cannot beleeve, for if they would have Bi≈øhops, why doe they not make them≈øelves Bi≈øhops? I know not what hindreth, why they might not have Bi≈øhops when they would. In the la≈øt place, for that which is alledged in relation to the government of this Kingdome, <hi>that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, as that the King cannot well let them goe with the ≈øafety of Monarchy, and that if Bi≈øhops bee taken away, A≈ø≈øemblies, or ≈øomething mu≈øt come in the roome thereof. And if Kings ≈øhould bee ≈øubject thereunto, and ≈øhould happen to be excommunicated thereby, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they would bee little esteemed, or obeyed as Kings:</hi> for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:156910:31"/>this, if it ≈øhall be cleared, as it is affirmed, or if any thing therein doe ≈øtrike at Monarchy, I ≈øhall never give my vote, nor con≈øent thereunto as long as I live. But to cleare that this is not ≈øo, I offer to your con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that by the Law of this Land not onely all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall Juri≈ødiction, but al≈øo all ≈øuperiority, and preheminence over the Eccle≈øia≈øticall ≈øtate, is annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, and may bee granted by Commi≈ø≈øion under the great ≈øeale, to ≈øuch per≈øons as his Maje≈øtie ≈øhall thinke meet: now, if the King ≈øhould grant it to a certaine number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners, equall in authority, as hee may doe, this were an abolition of Epi≈øcopacy, and yet not diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Monarchy; But the truth is, Epi≈øcopacy is a kind of Monarchy under a Monarchy, and is therein altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike the Civill <hi>Government</hi> under his Maje≈øtie: for the King being a common head over the Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall ≈øtate and the Civill, we ≈øhall finde that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of Civill Juri≈ødiction, in all Courts under his Maje≈øty, it is <hi>Ari≈øtocraticall,</hi> and placed in many, and not in one, as appeareth in this high Court of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the inferiour Courts of <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> Hall, and in the Sizes, and Se≈ø≈øions in the Countrey, which are held by many Commi≈ø≈øioners, and not onely by one, or his <hi>Deputies,</hi> and <hi>Commi≈ø≈øaries,</hi> as it is in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of Eccle≈øia≈øticall government. As to the point of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing that it did di≈ø≈øolve naturall and civill bonds of duty, as it doth not, it might indeed be as terrible to Princes, as it is repre≈øented. But I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon thus, <hi>either Princes are ≈øubject to Excommunication, or they are not: if they bee not, then they need as little to feare a Presbyterie or an a≈ø≈øembly, as a Bi≈øhop in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect; if they bee, they have as much to feare from Bi≈øhops, at lea≈øtwi≈øe from Bi≈øhops in their Convocations, as from Presbyters in their A≈ø≈øemblies; and ≈øo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they have formerly felt the thunderbolts of tho≈øe of

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:156910:33"/>that ≈øtampe, but never from this latter ≈øort.</hi> And now Sir, I proceede to repre≈øent unto you the evills, and inconveniences that doe proceede from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ceremonies of the Church, and truely in my opinion, <hi>the chiefe and principall cau≈øe of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills which we have ≈øuffered, ≈øince the Reformation in this Church and State, hath proceeded from that divi≈øion which ≈øo unhappily hath ≈øprung up amongst us, about Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Ceremonies of the Church, and from which part in that divi≈øion, I beleeve, it will appeare in the particulars.</hi> I know well there is a great divi≈øion, and that upon great matters, betweene us and the Papi≈øts, and I am not ignorant that there have beene great and ≈øore breaches made upon our Civill Liberties, and the right of our proprieties.</p>
               <p>But yet ≈øtill I returne to my former po≈øition, that the chiefe and mo≈øt active cau≈øe hath proceeded <hi>from the Government and Ceremonies of the Church,</hi> and that tho≈øe other cau≈øes have either fallen into it, and ≈øo acted by it, or i≈ø≈øued out of it, and ≈øo acted from it. As for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, <hi>I conceive that to have beene a cau≈øe that hath fallen into this, and acted by it;</hi> for at the <hi>Reformation</hi> it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ≈øuch a deadly wound by ≈øo many ≈øharpe Lawes ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted again≈øt it, that had it not beene enlivened by this divi≈øion among≈øt us, it could never have had influence upon our Church and State to have troubled them, as this day wee feele; but finding that in this divi≈øion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt us, one party had need of ≈øome of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls to maintaine their <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> together with their worldly pompe and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereunto; from hence they fir≈øt conceived a ground of hope, and afterwards found meanes of ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the introducing againe of their ≈øuper≈øtition and Idolatry into this Realme; and they wrought ≈øo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently upon this <hi>foundation,</hi> that they have advanced their building very farre, and how neare they were to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156910:33"/>≈øet up the Roofe, I leave it to your con≈øideration. As for the evills which <hi>we have ≈øuffered in our civill liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the right of our proprieties, J conceive they have proceeded out of this, and ≈øo acted from it; for if there had beene no breaches of</hi> Parliaments, <hi>there would have bin no need to have had recour≈øe unto tho≈øe broken Ci≈øternes, that can hold no water;</hi> but there being a ≈øtoppage of <hi>Parlamentary</hi> ≈øupplyes, that was an occa≈øion of letting in upon us ≈øuch an <hi>inundation of Monopolies,</hi> and other ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall taxes, and impo≈øitions, accompanyed with many other heavy and ≈øore breaches of our <hi>Liberties.</hi> Now there needed not to have beene any breaches of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> had there not beene ≈øomething <hi>di≈øliked in them,</hi> and what was that? it could not bee any of the≈øe <hi>civill</hi> matters that bred the fir≈øt difference, for they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of it, therefore I conceive it was this: <hi>The Prelates with their adherents</hi> (the Papi≈øts al≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with them for their intere≈øt) <hi>did alwayes looke upon Parliaments with an evill eye, as no friends to their offices and functions, at lea≈øtwi≈øe to their Benefices and Dignities, and therefore</hi> (≈øome of them having alwayes had the grace to bee too neare to the Princes eates) <hi>they have alwayes endeavoured to breed a di≈ø-affection in Kings from Parliaments, as the Pre≈ø≈øe and Pulpit doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly witne≈ø≈øe, and Ballads too, made by ≈øome of them upon the breaches of Parliaments.</hi> But wee have a fre≈øh and bleeding in≈øtance of this in the confirmation in his Maje≈øties name, which they procured to be prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their new Booke of Canons, wherein they have endeavoured to make this impre≈ø≈øion upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties Royall minde, <hi>that the Authors and Fomenters of the jealou≈øie in re≈øpect of the new Rites and Ceremonies lately introduced into the Church, which wee call innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did ≈øtrike at his Royall per≈øon, as if hee were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in his Religion, and did wor≈øhip God in a ≈øuperstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way, and intended to bring in ≈øome Innovation in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156910:34"/>matter of Religion.</hi> Now Sir, who are the authors of tho≈øe jealou≈øies? did they not come as complaints in the Petitions from the bodies of ≈øeverall Counties the la≈øt <hi>Parliament,</hi> and from more this pre≈øent <hi>Parliament?</hi> and who were the fomenters of tho≈øe jealou≈øies? did not the generall ≈øence of the la≈øt Parliament concurre in it, that they were Innovations, and that they were ≈øu≈øpitions, as introductory to ≈øuper≈øtition? Nay, I appeale to all tho≈øe that hear me, which are drawn from al parts of the Kingdom, whether this be not the generall ≈øence of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt con≈øiderable part of the whole Kingdom? <hi>I be≈øeech you then to con≈øider, what kind Offices the≈øe men have done between the King and the Parlament, between the King and Kingdom, I ≈øpeak of the greate≈øt and mo≈øt con≈øiderable par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I hold therefore, that the other way of ≈øatisfaction is the ≈øafe≈øt, the ea≈øie≈øt, and the onely way. And that is to take into con≈øideration, the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall heads of the evills, which are cau≈øes of the≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and to finde out, and apply the proper remedies thereunto.</hi> For the furtherance whereof, I ≈øhall make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156910:34"/>bold with your patience (which I am very unwilling to tire, but mu≈øt tire my owne Con≈øcience if I ≈øhould not di≈øcharge it upon this occa≈øion) to repre≈øent a briefe Modell of the ≈øeverall heads and ≈øprings from whence the evills, which are cau≈øes of the≈øe complaints, doe naturally or occa≈øionally ari≈øe. The evils complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of, doe either ari≈øe from per≈øons, or from things; tho≈øe faults that are per≈øonall are be≈øides the poynt that I intend to ≈øpeake to, there is one onely remedy for them, that is, by puni≈øhment and removall of ≈øuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and the putting of better in their roome. As for tho≈øe evills which proceed from things, they al≈øo are remedied by a removall of ≈øuch things as are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the putting of better in their roome; the evills and inconveniences of this kinde doe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally flow, either from the Clergies Offices and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or from their Benefices and Dignities; tho≈øe that ari≈øe from their Offices and functions, doe ari≈øe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally either from the Lawes and Con≈øtitutions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and according to which they exerci≈øe their Offices and functions, or from the Government it ≈øelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they exerci≈øe tho≈øe functions. The faults that I note in the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Lawes are, that they hold too much of the Civill Law, and too much of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law: Of the Civill Law, in re≈øpect of all tho≈øe Titles concerning Wills, and Legacies, tithes, marriages, adulteries, which all belonging to the Civill juri≈ødiction, and are no more of ≈øpirituall con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, than rapes, thefts, fellonies, or trea≈øons may bee. Sir, it is good that every bird ≈øhould have his owne feather, and I remember when one came to our <hi>Saviour Chri≈øt, to de≈øire him that hee would cau≈øe his Brother to divide the inheritance with him, hee asked him; who made him a Iudge of ≈øuch things:</hi> and may not we aske, who made them that take them≈øelves to bee ≈øucce≈ø≈øours of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, Judges of ≈øuch

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:156910:37"/>Common-wealth. (Sir) untill the Eccle≈øia≈øticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be framed ≈øomething of another twi≈øt, and be more a≈ø≈øimilated unto that of the Common-wealth, I feare the Eccle≈øia≈øticall government will bee no good neighbour unto the Civill, but will be ≈øtill a ca≈øting in of its leaven into it, to reduce that al≈øo to a ≈øole, ab≈øolute, and arbitrary way of proceeding: And herein (Sir) I doe not beleeve, that I utter Prophe≈øies, but what wee have already found and felt.</p>
               <p>A ≈øecond, and that a great evill, and of dangerous con≈øequence, in this ≈øole and arbitrary power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops over their Clergy, is this, that they have by that meanes, a power to place, and di≈øplace the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of their Dioce≈ø≈øe at their plea≈øure: and this is ≈øuch a power, as for my part, I had rather they had the like power over the E≈øtate and per≈øons of all within their Dioce≈ø≈øe; for if I hold the one, but at the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of one man, (I meane the Mini≈øtery under which I mu≈øt live) I can have but little, or at lea≈øt no certain joy nor comfort in the other. But this is not all, for if they have ≈øuch a power to mould the Clergy of their Dioce≈ø≈øes, according to their plea≈øure, wee know what an Influence they may have by them upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; that in a ≈øhort time they may bring them to ≈øuch blindne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo mould them al≈øo to their owne wills, as that they may bring in what Religion they plea≈øe: nay, having put out our eyes, as the <hi>Phili≈øtins</hi> did <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons,</hi> they may afterwards make us grinde, and reduce us unto what ≈ølavery they plea≈øe, either unto them≈øelves, as formerly they have done, or unto others, as ≈øome of them lately have beene forward enough to doe. Now whether it be ≈øafe to walke upon Stilts on the top of the pinacles of the Temple, upon ≈øo high <hi>precipices,</hi> as are the matters of Religion and Con≈øcience (which may have al≈øo a dangerous Influence upon our civill liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) I leave it to your con≈øideration: for my part I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:156910:37"/>≈øhould not thinke it ≈øafe, that ≈øuch a power ≈øhould bee in any one man, though you ≈øuppo≈øe him to be a very good man.</p>
               <p>A third evill, and that of dangerous con≈øequence, is that the doore is ≈øhut again≈øt able and painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Mini≈øters,</hi> and a wide doore ≈øet open to tho≈øe that are unable, and unfit for that function, and the Bi≈øhops intere≈øt is concerned in it, that it ≈øhould bee ≈øo, <hi>Intere≈øt of honour, Intere≈øt of profit, and Intere≈øt of power, Intere≈øt of credit;</hi> for they ≈øee that tho≈øe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preachers carry away all the credit from them, and they neither can nor will doe the like them≈øelves: they cannot by rea≈øon they are ≈øo intangled with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of this world, and civill juri≈ødiction; they will not, their great Dignities and Honours make them ≈øo ≈øtately, that they thinke it is not Epi≈øcopall to preach often; and on the other ≈øide, they are ≈øo fat, and live ≈øo much at their ea≈øe, that through idlene≈ø≈øe they cannot bring their mindes unto it, and ≈øo fir≈øt ari≈øeth envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt tho≈øe that doe take paines, and thence after ≈øpringeth per≈øecution. In the next place, <hi>their Intere≈øt is concerned in matter of profit: for they ≈øuppo≈øe, that if the credit of their</hi> Diana <hi>fall to the ground, their gaine will after cea≈øe, and that the people will thinke much, that ≈øome men ≈øhould take all the paines, and other goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all the profit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>La≈øtly, <hi>their Intere≈øt is concerned in it, in poynt of power, for they finde that neither ≈øuch preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, nor their Auditors, are ≈øo plyable to yield blinde Canonicall obedience, as others are: and ≈øo it concernes them in poynt of power to ≈øtop their mouthes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it mu≈øt needes follow by the rule of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, that it mu≈øt be for their profit, honour, and power, to ≈øet open a docre to idle and unfit Mini≈øters.</hi> But there are two particulars which I will note, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes them in their profits, to ≈øet the doore very
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:156910:38"/>wide open, where there is no ≈øu≈øpition of <hi>refractorine≈ø≈øe:</hi> Fir≈øt, we know Bi≈øhops have many times <hi>Livings</hi> in <hi>Commendum</hi> and <hi>Pluralities:</hi> but there is hardly any, but they have impropriations, whereof they are to ≈øee the Cure di≈øcharged, and therefore it is for their profit, that there may be good ≈øtore of cheap Curates, which cannot be very fit and able men; and with ≈øuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they furni≈øh the Cures of ≈øuch places whereof they have the Impropriations. (Sir) In the next place we know, that orders are not given, but in a manner ≈øold, for not onely the Bi≈øhop, and his Regi≈øter, but al≈øo his U≈øher, his Chamberlaine, his Butler, and Porter, and almo≈øt all his meniall ≈øervants mu≈øt have their fees, before the poore Clerke with his Boxe full of Orders can pa≈ø≈øe the Porters Lodge. I heare much of the legall Simony, which con≈øi≈øteth in the buying and ≈øelling of Benefices, but whether this doth not approach nearer to the Evangelicall Simony, which con≈øi≈øteth in the buying and ≈øelling of the gifts of the holy Gho≈øt; I offer it to your con≈øideration. Now (Sir) for Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Ab≈øolution, all ≈øeemes to be out of poynt, for Excommunication is neither in right hands, nor exerci≈øed upon right grounds and matters, nor in a right forme and manner, nor to right ends, and then it is no marvell if it have not right effects. (Sir) we know our Saviour hath lodged it in the Church (for ≈øo runs the precept) <hi>dic Eccle≈øiae:</hi> now (Sir) that one man ≈øhould bee a Church, ≈øounds ≈øtrangely in my eares. In the next place (I bo≈øeech you Sir) con≈øider about what their Spirituall Sword is exerci≈øed, about things no way lying under the ≈øtroke thereof; A man ≈øhall be excommunicated for a Pig, or for an Apple, and ≈øuch like things: I heard once a Gentleman of the Civill Law an≈øwer hereunto in this hou≈øe, that the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was not for the thing, but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and the le≈ø≈øe the thing was, that was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:156910:38"/>the greater was the contempt: If this were ≈øo, ≈øure the greater is the cruelty, to lay command upon ≈øo ≈ømall a matter, that draweth after it ≈øo deepe a cen≈øure, as to ca≈øt a man downe into Hell. Suppo≈øe a Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould command ≈øome triviall matter, ≈øome ceremony or other, under pain of trea≈øon, and ≈øhould proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Infringers of his command as Traytors, it were much to be doubted, whether the command did not partake more of cruelty, than the di≈øobedience of contempt; for when authority ≈øhall ≈øo farre lo≈øe it ≈øelfe, as to lay ≈øo great a weight upon ≈øo ≈ømall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it rend reth it ≈øelfe contemptible, and then it is no marvaile (I had almo≈øt ≈øayd) it is no fault, if it bee contemned, having made it ≈øelfe contemptible. Then Sir, for the forme of proceeding, it is no whit ≈øpirituall, there is no fa≈øting and prayer, no ≈øeeking to reclaime the ≈øinner, but rather it is after the fa≈øhion of a ≈øummary Proce≈ø≈øe in a civill Court, nay, Sir, it is accompanyed ≈øometimes with an intimation that no man ≈øhall buy or ≈øell with the per≈øon excommunicated, nor ≈øet him a worke, nor doe any civill or naturall offices unto him. As wee had a complaint brought in this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of a Sonne that was excommunicated onely for repeating a Sermon to his father, being an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate per≈øon. Now Sir, for the ends for which this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure is executed, they are ordinarily to fetch in fees, or at the be≈øt to bring men under Canonicall obedience, which is the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> will and plea≈øure, and I have ≈øometimes ≈øeene a <hi>Mini≈øter</hi> pronounce an <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> which he held in one hand, and pre≈øently after the ab≈øolution which he held in the other, ≈øo the end of the excommunication was the ab≈øolution, and the end of that was fees: (Sir) for the honour of God, for the honour of our nationall Church, and for the honour of the Chri≈øtian Religion, let the high and great cen≈øure of the Church no longer lackey after fees, let not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:156910:39"/>Chri≈øtians any longer be ea≈øt to Sathan, in the name of <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> for the non payment of a groat. And now Sir, we may imagine what effects are like to follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øuch premi≈øes, the great and dreadfull cen≈øure of Excommunication is thereby made contemptible, and were it not for the civill re≈øtraints, and penalties that follow upon it, no man would purcha≈øe an ab≈øolution, though he may have it for a halfe-peny. And I have heard of ≈øome that have thanked the Ordinaries for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating or remitting the fees of the Courts: but I never heard of any that thanked them, for reclaiming their ≈øoules to repentance, by their Excommunications; (Sir) for ab≈øolution, it is relative to excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ≈øo labours of the ≈øame di≈øea≈øes: onely one thing I ≈øhall particularly note concerning ab≈øolution, (Sir) it is called commutation of penance, but indeed it is a de≈øtruction of the Ordinance, making it voyd, and of none effect, and ≈øurely God never ≈øet his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters to ≈øell indulgences in his Church. The oath that is to precede ab≈øolution, <hi>de parendo juri eccle≈øia, &amp; ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, &amp;c.</hi> hath already beene ≈øufficiently ≈øpoken unto, in the debate about the Canons, and therefore there will bee no need of ≈øpeaking more to that. Now Sir, I am come to my la≈øt head, wherein I ≈øhall be very briefe; and that is concerning the evills that ari≈øe out of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices and dignities of the Clergy, the common cau≈øe being from the inequality of the di≈øtribution of them, much re≈øembling a di≈øea≈øe very ordinary at this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt Children, which they call the Rickets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the nouri≈øhment goeth all to the upper parts, which are over-great and mon≈øtrous, and the lower parts pine away: and ≈øo it is in the Clergy, ≈øome are ≈øo poore, that they cannot attend their Mini≈øtery, but are faine to keepe ≈øchooles, nay, Ale-hou≈øes ≈øome of them; and ≈øome others are ≈øo ≈øtately, they will not attend their Mini≈øtery, and ≈øo between them the flock ≈øtarves: but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:156910:39"/>our evills have more e≈øpecially proceeded from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øive worldly wealth, and dignities of one part of the Clergie, I meane ≈øuch as either are in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, or in hopes of Bi≈øhopricks, for the≈øe great places of profit and honour, fir≈øt, have beene the baites of ambition, and then they became the apples of contention, and la≈øt of all, the ≈øeeds of ≈øuper≈øtition, the one being a ≈øtep and degree unto the other, and all of them leading in the end to the corruption, (that I may not ≈øay ≈øubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion) of our Religion. Sir, they are fir≈øt the baites of ambition, and I know not by what ≈øecret cau≈øe, but experience ≈øheweth us, that when Clergy men have once ta≈øted the ≈øweet of worldly wealth and honours, they are more eager and ambitious after them than any other ≈øort of men; here upon other godly Mini≈øters, that live more according to the ≈øimplicity of the Go≈øpell, and the example of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his Apo≈øtles, cannot but beare witne≈ø≈øe again≈øt their wordly pomp and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ≈øo the fire of contention breaketh forth. And truely (Sir) the ≈øtate of the Clergy is very like to fire, which whil≈øt it keeps in the Chimney, it is of excellent u≈øe to warme tho≈øe that approach unto it, but if it once breake out into the hou≈øe, and get upon the hou≈øe top, it ≈øets all on fire: ≈øo whil≈øt the Clergy keepe them≈øelves within the pulpit, they are of great u≈øe to ≈øtirre up the zeale and devotion of Chri≈øtians, but if they once flye out into the hou≈øe, if they begin to meddle with Civill places and juri≈ødictions, and e≈øpecially if they once get up to the Coun≈øell-table, it is ≈øeldome ≈øeene, but that at length they ≈øet all on fire; and what is it that maketh the fire to breake out of the chimney, but too much fuell? if there be but a moderate propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fuell, the fire keepes it ≈øelfe within its bounds, but if you heape faggot upon faggot, a whole Cart load together, then it breaketh out: (So Sir) if there bee a competent maintenance for the Mini≈øtery, they will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:156910:40"/>keep them≈øelves within their bounds, but if Living be heaped upon Living, and Temporalities added to Spiritualities, the flame will ≈øoone breake out, and ≈øet the hou≈øe on fire. (Sir) I doe not envy the wealth or greatne≈ø≈øe of the Clergy, but I am very confident, if tho≈øe were le≈ø≈øe, they would be better, and doe more ≈øervice to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his <hi>Church;</hi> and I am very clear in mine owne heart, that the livings of the Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more equally di≈øtributed, the ≈øervice of God would be ≈øo farre from receiving any prejudice, that it would bee much advanced, and withall a good proportion of revenue might returne againe to the Crowne, from whence it was fir≈øt derived. (Sir) <hi>Bi≈øhopricks, Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Chapiters, are like to great wa≈øters in a Wood, they make no proofe them≈øelves, they cumber the ground whereon they ≈øtand, and with their great Armes and Boughes ≈øtreiched forth on every ≈øide, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their ≈øhade, and partly by their ≈øowre droppings, they hinder all the young wood under them from growing and thriving.</hi> To ≈øpeake plaine Engli≈øh, the≈øe Bi≈øhops, Deanes, and Chapiters, doe little good them≈øelves by preaching, or otherwi≈øe; and if they were felled, a great deale of good timber might be cut out of them, for the u≈øes of the Church, and Kingdome at this time. A fre≈øh ≈øtoole of three or foure able Mini≈øters might ≈øpring up in their ≈øtead to very good purpo≈øe in the≈øe great Townes, which are Ordinarily the Seats of tho≈øe Epi≈øcopall, and Collegiate Churches, and the private Congregations of divers Parochiall Churches might thrive and grow better, which now have the Sunne of Gods Word, I meane the cleare and ≈øpirituall preaching thereof kept from them, and live in the dangerous ≈øhade of ignorance, by rea≈øon that all the meanes is taken from them, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Bi≈øhops, or to Deanries, and Chaptiers, and other ≈øuch Collegiate Churches. Be≈øides, ≈øuch as doe begin to grow and ≈øtart up through the voluntary pains
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:156910:40"/>of ≈øome among≈øt them, or<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by ≈øuch preaching as they them≈øelves have procured by their voluntary contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ≈øhould not ≈øtill bee dropped on as they are from the armes and appendances of tho≈øe great wa≈øters, and kept downe continually by their bitter per≈øecutions. That which remaines now, is to ≈øhew how the≈øe great Revenues and Dignities, become the ≈øeedes of ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtition, and that is this: <hi>The Clergy in the maintenance of their greatne≈ø≈øe, which they are neither willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, nor yet well able to maintaine upon the principles of the Reformed Religion, finding that the popi≈øh principles, whereon the Bi≈øhop of</hi> Rome <hi>built his greatne≈ø≈øe, to ≈øuit well unto their ends, that maketh them to ≈øide with that party, and that mu≈øt needs bring in ≈øuper≈øtition: and as ambition allureth on the one ≈øide, ≈øo the principles they goe by, draw them on farther and farther, and happily at length farther than they them≈øelves at fir≈øt intended.</hi> Whether a reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> were imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or no by ≈øome I leave it to every one to judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him≈øelfe: But ≈øure I am, if an accommodation could have beene made in ≈øome fa≈øhion or other, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Clergy might againe be capable of forraigne preferments, and <hi>Cardinals</hi> Caps, and this is no ≈ømall temptation. Now Sir, I am at an end, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ≈øhall draw out three conclu≈øions, which I conceive may clearely be collected out of what I have ≈øaid. <hi>Fir≈øt, that civill juri≈ødiction in the per≈øons of Clergy-men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their great Revenues, and high places of dignity, is one great cau≈øe of the evills which we ≈øuffer in matter of Religion. Secondly, that the ≈øole and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of Bi≈øhops in the ordaining and detriving of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and in Excommunication, and ab≈øolution, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great cau≈øe of the evills we ≈øuffer in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, the ≈øtrict urging of Sub≈øcription, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Ceremonies, and Canons of the Church is another great cau≈øe of evill, which wee ≈øuffer in matter of Religion.</hi>

               <p>And now my humble motion is, that we ≈øhould take a piece onely of this ≈øubject into our con≈øideration, but the whole matter, and that not onely that part of the Mini≈øters Remon≈øtrance, which hath beene read, ≈øhould be referred to the Committee which you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to name, but <hi>Londons</hi> Petition al≈øo, and all other Petitions of the like nature, ≈øo ≈øoone as they ≈øhall bee read in the hou≈øe, and that the Committee may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of them all ≈øuch heads as are fit for the con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this hou≈øe, and ≈øurely that is fit to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, that happily will not be thought fit to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: con≈øideration is one thing, and alteration another: where there is a mixture of bad and good together, the whole mu≈øt bee con≈øidered, that we may know how to ≈øever the good from the bad, and ≈øo retaine the one, and reject the other, which is all that I de≈øire.

                  </p>
                  <p>A third way is a way of violence, this violence they exerci≈øe partly by Secular <hi>Armes,</hi> and partly by Prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Armes,</hi> which they call Spirituall: for Secular <hi>Armes</hi> we have their owne confe≈ø≈øion, that the late warre was <hi>Bellum Epi≈øcopale;</hi> and we have the Papi≈øts confe≈ø≈øion, that it was <hi>Bellum Papale;</hi> for in their motives, they ≈øay, <hi>That the warre concernes them not onely as ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but as Catholikes,</hi> for ≈øo they fal≈øely call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves: and if it be ≈øo, then <hi>Bellum Epi≈øcopale,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo <hi>Bellum Papale:</hi> in the <hi>Epi≈øcopall</hi> Warre, the <hi>Papall</hi> cau≈øe is advanced: For the Spirituall <hi>Armes,</hi> thus they come to execution.</p>
                  <p>When a great Man is comming, his Sumpters, his Furniture, his Provi≈øions goe before: the <hi>Popes</hi> Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Copes, Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> are come before; (and if wee beleeve Dr. <hi>Co≈ø≈øens</hi>) the very ≈øub≈øtance of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe;</hi> a certaine ≈øigne that the <hi>Pope</hi> was not farre off.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:156910:43"/>Degradation, and Deprivation. And by the≈øe <hi>Armes</hi> hath Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> beene oppre≈ø≈øed and undone. Hee falls upon their Super≈øtitions, and Innovations, and they fall upon him with their <hi>Armes,</hi> they beate him down, yea they pull him up by the rootes, taking away all his meanes of maintenance and living; yet they leave him life to feele his mi≈øeries; <hi>Ita feriunt, ut diu ≈øe ≈øentiat mori;</hi> there is no cruelty to Prie≈øty cruelty; the≈øe are they that did put our very Saviour to death: the <hi>Calling</hi> is Reverend, but the Corruption of it mo≈øt pernicious; <hi>Corruptio optimi pe≈øsima:</hi> I know no rea≈øon of this change, except it be that of the Apo≈øtle: <hi>Becau≈øe when they knew God, they did not wor≈øhip him as God,</hi> but made a God of the World, placing the excellency of <hi>Priesthood</hi> in worldly pompe and greatne≈ø≈øe, and gave the glory of the invi≈øible God, to <hi>Pictures, Images,</hi> and <hi>Altars:</hi> therefore God gave them up to vile affections, to be implacable, unmercifull, and without naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

                  <p>And now it is prayed, <hi>that as the≈øe Delinquents by the cruell oppre≈øsions of Mr.</hi> Smart <hi>have advanced the Cau≈øe of</hi> Popery, <hi>≈øo they may in ≈øuch a degree of Iustice bee puni≈øhed, that in them</hi> Prie≈øtly <hi>cruelty, and the very cau≈øe of</hi> Popery <hi>may appeare to be puni≈øhed and ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, and that Mr.</hi> Smart <hi>≈øuffering for the Cau≈øe of</hi> Prote≈øtancy <hi>may bee ≈øo repaired, that in him pious Con≈øtancy, and the very Cau≈øe of</hi> Prote≈øtancy <hi>may appeare to be righted and repaired.</hi>

If this bee not proper to a Parliament, I know not what is. Nay it is the highe≈øt matter that can fall under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of a Parliament, and ≈øuch a poynt as wherein they would have walked with more tenderne≈ø≈øe and circum≈øpection than the≈øe bold Divines have done. And ≈øurely, as this was an act of ≈øuch pre≈øumption as no age can parallell: ≈øo is it of ≈øuch dangerous con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as nothing can be more. For they doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take upon them to determine matters of this nature, but al≈øo under great penalties, forbid all Par≈øons, Vicars, Curates, Readers in Divinity, &amp;c. to ≈øpeake any other wayes of them then as they had defined, by which meanes having ≈øeized upon all the Conduites, whereby knowledge is convayed to the people, how ea≈øie would it bee for them in time, to undermine the Kings Prerogative, and to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the ≈øubjects liberty, or both.</p>
               <p>And now (Sir) I be≈øeech you to con≈øider how they have defined this high and great poynt: they have dealt with us in matter of Divinity, as the Judges had done before in matter of Law: they fir≈øt tooke upon them to determine a matter that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to their Judicature, but onely to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after by their judgement they overthrew our propriety, and ju≈øt ≈øo have the≈øe Divines dealt with us: they tell us that Kings are an Ordinance of God, of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and founded in the prime Lawes of Nature, from whence it will follow that all other formes of government, as <hi>Ari≈øtocracies,</hi> and <hi>Democracies,</hi> are wicked formes of government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Ordinance of God, and the Prime Lawes of Nature, which is ≈øuch new Divinitie as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:156910:45"/>never read in any Booke, but in this new Booke of Canons.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> We all know that Kings, and States, and Iudges, and all Magi≈øtrates are the Ordinances of God, but (Sir) give mee leave to ≈øay they were the Ordinances of men, before they were the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God. I know I am upon a great and high poynt, but I ≈øpeake by as great and as high a warrant, if St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> chaire cannot erre (as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epi≈øtles cannot) thus he teacheth us, <hi>Submit your ≈øelfe to-every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for the Lords ≈øake, whether it bee to the King as ≈øupreame, or to the Governour, as to him that is ≈øent by him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(Sir) It is worthy noting, that they are Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men, but that they are to be ≈øubmitted unto for the Lords ≈øake, and truely their power is as ju≈øt, and their ≈øubjects allegeance as due unto them, though we ≈øuppo≈øe them to bee fir≈øt ordinances of men, and then confirmed, and e≈øtabli≈øhed by Gods Ordinance, as if wee ≈øuppo≈øe them to bee immediate Ordinances of God, and ≈øo received by men. But there was ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it, that the≈øe Divines aimed at, I ≈øuppo≈øe it was this. If Kings were of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> as the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Pa≈øtor in the Church, or founded in the prime Lawes of Nature, as the power of a Father in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then it would certainly follow, that they ≈øhould receive the fa≈øhion and manner of their government, onely from the Pre≈øcript of Gods Word, or of the Lawes of Nature, and con≈øequently, if there bee no Text, neither of the <hi>Old</hi> nor <hi>New Testament,</hi> nor yet any Law of Nature, that Kings may not make Lawes without <hi>Parliaments,</hi> they may make Lawes without <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and if neither in the Scripture, nor in the Law of Nature, Kings be forbidden to lay taxes or any kind of impo≈øitions upon their people without con≈øent in Parliament, they may doe it out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:156910:46"/>and that this was their meaning, they expre≈ø≈øe it after in plaine termes, for they ≈øay that Sub≈øidies and taxes, and all manner of ayds are due unto Kings by the Law of God, and of Nature. (Sir) if they bee due by the Law of God and of Nature, they are due, though there be no act of Parliament for them: nay (Sir) if they bee due by ≈øuch a right, a hundred acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot take them away, or make them undue. And (Sir) that they meant it of Sub≈øidies and aids ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without con≈øent in Parliament, is clearely that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they ≈øubjoyne unto it, that this doth not take away from the Subject the propriety hee hath in his goods, for had they ≈øpoken of Sub≈øidies and aydes given by con≈øent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> this would have been a very ridiculous addition, for who ever made any que≈øtion, whether the giving Sub≈øidies in Parliament did take away from the Subject the propriety hee hath in his goods, when as it doth evidently imply they have a propriety in their goods? for they could not give unle≈ø≈øe they had ≈øomething to give: but becau≈øe that was alledged as a chiefe rea≈øon again≈øt Ship-mens, and other ≈øuch illegall payments levied upon the people, without their con≈øent in Parliament, that it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their right of propriety, which they have in their goods, the≈øe <hi>Divines</hi> would ≈øeem to make ≈øome an≈øwer thereunto, but in truth their an≈øwer is nothing el≈øe but the bare a≈ø≈øertion of a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is an ea≈øie thing to ≈øay a contradiction, but impo≈ø≈øible to reconcile it; for certainely if it bee a true rule (as it is mo≈øt true) <hi>quod meum e≈øt ≈øine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øu meo, non pote≈øt fieri alienum;</hi> to take my goods without my con≈øent mu≈øt needes de≈øtroy my propriety. Another thing in this fir≈øt Canon, wherein they have a≈ø≈øumed unto them≈øelves a <hi>Parliamentarie</hi> power, is in that they take upon them to define what is Trea≈øon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides what is determined in the ≈øtatute of Trea≈øons.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:156910:46"/>They ≈øay, to ≈øet up any coactive independent power is trea≈øonable both again≈øt God and the King, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion is not whether it bee true they ≈øay or no, but whether they have power to ≈øay what is Trea≈øon, and what not? But now (Sir) that I am upon this point, <hi>I would gladly know what kinde of power that is, which is exerci≈øed by Arch-Bi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> Coactive certainely it is, all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome feeles the la≈øh thereof, and it mu≈øt needs bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant, if it be <hi>jure Divine,</hi> as they hold it, for they doe not meane by an independant power, ≈øuch a power as doth not depend on GOD. Be≈øides, if their power be dependant, of whom is it dependant? not of the King, for the Law acknowledgeth no way whereby Eccle≈øia≈øticall juri≈ødiction can bee derived from his Maje≈øtie, but by his Commi≈ø≈øion under the great-Scale, which as I am informed, they have not: <hi>I ≈øpeake not of the High Commi≈ø≈øion, but of that juri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they exerci≈øe in their Archiepi≈øcopall, Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, Archidaconall Courts, &amp;c. and therefore if their owne ≈øentence bee ju≈øt, wee know what they are, and what they have pronounced again≈øt them≈øelves.</hi> But (Sir) it were worth knowing what they aimed at in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent coactive power, which they terme popular. <hi>I will not take upon me to unfold their meaning; but wee know Doctor</hi> Beale <hi>had a hand in the making of the≈øe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and if wee apply his</hi> Paraphra≈øe <hi>to the</hi> Text, <hi>it may give us ≈øome clearene≈ø≈øe.</hi> I remember among≈øt other notes of his this was one, that he did acknowledge the Kings Supremacy, but would joyne unto him an a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant <hi>(viz.)</hi> the people, meaning this Hou≈øe, which being the repre≈øentative body of the COMMONS of <hi>England,</hi> and claiming, as it is ≈øo, a ≈øhare in the Legi≈ølative power, Doctor <hi>Beale</hi> calleth this a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to the King, in whom ≈øoly hee placeth the power of making Lawes, and that it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:156910:47"/>is but of grace, that he a≈ø≈øumeth either the Lords, or Commons for the making of Lawes with him. Now (Sir) the <hi>Legi≈ølative</hi> power is the greate≈øt power, and therefore coactive, and it is the highe≈øt power, and therefore independent, and if every E≈øtate for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it hath therein, ≈øhould not have ≈øuch a power, it ≈øhould not have it of right, as founded in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke and frame of the policy and government, but of Grace, or by Commi≈ø≈øion, as Dr. <hi>Beale</hi> affirmeth. I have done with the fir≈øt Canon, onely I ≈øhall adde this, that con≈øidering the principles and po≈øitions that are laid downe therein, and comparing them with a clau≈øe towards the end of the Canon, that in no ca≈øe imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is lawfull for ≈øubjects to defend them≈øelves, we may judge how farre forth the≈øe Canons were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare mens mindes for the force that was to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if the accu≈øation again≈øt my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> bee layed aright. For the matter it ≈øelfe, I hope there will never be any need to di≈øpute that que≈øtion, and I doe beleeve they had as little need, to have publi≈øhed that po≈øition, had it not beene upon de≈øigne. As for the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Canon, therein al≈øo they have a≈ø≈øumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves a Parliamentary power, in taking upon them, to appoynt Holidayes, whereas the ≈øtatute ≈øaith in expre≈ø≈øe words, that ≈øuch dayes ≈øhall bee onely kept as Holy-dayes as are named in the Statute, and no other, and therefore though the thing may be <hi>bonum,</hi> yet it was not done <hi>bene,</hi> becau≈øe not ordained by Parliament, notwith≈øtanding what hath beene alledged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: it ≈øeemeth to mee to bee the appoynting of an Holy-day, to ≈øet a time a part for Divine ≈øervice, and to force menunder penalties to leave their labours, and bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and to be pre≈øent at it. And of the ≈øame nature is that other clau≈øe, in the ≈øame Canon, wherein they take upon them without <hi>Parliament,</hi> to lay a charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people, enjoyning two Bookes at lea≈øt for that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:156910:47"/>day, to be bought at the charge of the pari≈øh, for by the ≈øame right, that they may lay a penny on the Pari≈øh without <hi>Parliament,</hi> they may lay a pound or any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øumme.</p>
               <p>As to the third Canon, I ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe it over, onely the ob≈øervation that my neighbour of the long Robe made upon it, ≈øeemes unto me ≈øo good, as that it is worth the repeating, that whereas in the Canon again≈øt Sectaries there is an e≈øpeciall <hi>provi≈øo,</hi> that it ≈øhall not derogate from any Statute, or Law made again≈øt them (as if their Canons had any power to di≈øanull an act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) there is no ≈øuch <hi>provi≈øo</hi> in this Canon again≈øt Papi≈øts, from whence it may bee probably conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they might have drawne ≈øome colour of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the penall Lawes e≈øtabli≈øhed again≈øt them from this Canon, becau≈øe it might ≈øeeme hard that they ≈øhould be doubly puni≈øhed for the ≈øame thing, as wee know in the poynt of ab≈øence from the Church; the Law provideth, that if any man be fir≈øt puni≈øhed by the Ordinary, he ≈øhall not be puni≈øhed againe by the Iu≈øtices.</p>

               <p>(Sir) if in things that are in their owne Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, if in things di≈øputable it ≈øhall bee as hainous to abett or maintaine an opinion, as in the mo≈øt horrible and mon≈øtrous herefies, that can be imagined, what liberty is left to us as Chri≈øtians?

               <p>For the bold part of this <hi>Petition,</hi> Sir, what can there be of greater pre≈øumption, than for <hi>petitioners,</hi> not onely to pre≈øcribe to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> what, and how it ≈øhall doe; but for a multitude to teach a Parliament, what, and what is not the government according to Gods word.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, what is the <hi>Petition</hi> again≈øt? is it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed by Acts of Parliament? Is it not again≈øt the Liturgy, again≈øt ≈øeverall formes of Divine ≈øervice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the ≈øame Authority?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Parliament may mend, may alter, may repeale Lawes, may make new, and I hope, in due ≈øea≈øon wee ≈øhall doe ≈øo in poynt of Church-government: but in the meane time let me tell you, Sir, I cannot but e≈øteeme it an irreverence, an high pre≈øumption in any, to <hi>petition</hi> point blank again≈øt a Law, or Government in force.</p>

               <p>Beleeve me, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> all the reverence and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which we expect from future times to our owne Acts hereafter depends upon our upholding the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of what former Parliaments have done, even in tho≈øe things which in their due time we may de≈øire, and intend to rever≈øe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we all agree upon this; that a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Church <hi>Government</hi> is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, and our happy unity of opinions herein ≈øhould be one argument unto us to ≈øtay there; but, Sir, to ≈øtrike at the Roote, to attempt a totall Alteration, before ever I can give my vote unto that, three things mu≈øt be made manife≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that the mi≈øchiefes which we have felt under Epi≈øcopall Government flow from the nature of the function, not from the abu≈øes of it onely, that is, that no Rules, no Boundaries can be ≈øet to Bi≈øhops able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine them from ≈øuch Exorbitances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ≈øuch a frame of Government mu≈øt be laid before us, as no time, no Corruption can make lyable to proportionable inconveniences with that which we aboli≈øh.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, it mu≈øt be made to appeare that this <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> is practicable.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt, Sir, that Epi≈øcopacy a function deduced through all ages of Chri≈øts Church, from the Apo≈øtles times, and continued by the mo≈øt venerable and ≈øacred Order Eccle≈øia≈øtical; and function dignified by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Piety of ≈øo many Fathers of the Church, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by ≈øo many Martyrdomes in the Primitive times,

               <p>For the ≈øecond, I know not the ≈øtrength of other mens fancies, but I will confe≈ø≈øe unto you ingenuou≈øly the weakne≈ø≈øe of my faith in the poynt, that I doe not beleeve there can any other government bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, but will in time bee ≈øubject to as great or greater inconveniences than Epi≈øcopacy, I meane Epi≈øcopacy ≈øo ordered, reduced, and limitted, as I ≈øuppo≈øe it may bee by firme and ≈øolid Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries.</p>

               <p>And the in≈øight into dangers of any new way that ≈øhall be propo≈øed being to ri≈øe onely from ≈øpeculation, the apprehen≈øion of the one is likely to be much more operative than of the other, though perh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For my part (though no State≈øman) I will ≈øpeake my minde freely in this. I doe not thinke a King can put downe Bi≈øhops totally with ≈øafety to Monarchy; not that there is any ≈øuch allyance as men talk of 'twixt the Myter and the Crowne, but from this rea≈øon; that upon the putting downe of Bi≈øhops, the Government of A≈ø≈øemblies is likely to ≈øucceed it, That (to bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall) mu≈øt draw to it ≈øelfe the ≈øupremacy of Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall juri≈ødiction that (con≈øequently) the power of Excommunicating Kings as well as any other brother in Chri≈øt, and if a King chance to be delivered over to Sathan, judge whether men are likely to care much what becomes of him next.</p>
               <p>The≈øe things con≈øidered M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let us lay a≈øide all thoughts of ≈øuch dangerous, ≈øuch fundamentall, ≈øuch unaccompli≈øhed Alterations: and all thought of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing tho≈øe thoughts in others; let us all re≈øolve upon that cour≈øe wherein (with union) wee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably promi≈øe our ≈øelves ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, happine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is in a through Reformation.</p>
               <p>To that, no mans vote ≈øhall be given with more zeale, with more heartine≈ø≈øe than mine. Let us not de≈øtroy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, but make Bi≈øhops ≈øuch as they were in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times.</p>
               <p>Doe their large Terriories, their large Revenues of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend? let them be retrencht, the good Bi≈øhops of <hi>Hippo</hi> had but a narrow Dioce≈ø≈øe.</p>

               <p>Doe their Courts and ≈øubordinates offend? let them be brought to governe as in the Primitive times, by A≈ø≈øemblies of their Clergy.</p>
               <p>Doth their intermedling in ≈øecular affaires offend? exclude them from the capacity, it is no more than what Rea≈øon, and all Antiquity hath interdicted them.</p>
               <p>That all this may bee the better effected, M. <hi>Speaker</hi> my mottion is, that; Fir≈øt, we may appoynt a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to collect all grievances ≈øpringing from the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government of the Church (to which the Mini≈øters head of Government will bee ≈øufficient without countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this Petition by a Commitment) and to repre≈øent it to this hou≈øe in a Body.</p>
               <p>And in the next place that wee may (if it ≈øtand with the order of Parliaments) de≈øire that there may bee a ≈øtanding Committee of certain members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, who (with a number of ≈øuch learned Mini≈øters as the Hou≈øes ≈øhall nominate for A≈ø≈øi≈øtants) may take into con≈øideration all the≈øe grievances, and advi≈øe of the be≈øt way to ≈øettle peace and ≈øatisfaction in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, to the comfort of all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, and all good Common-wealths Men.</p>

                  <item>2 The ≈øecond is <hi>Ius humanum Con≈øtantii donativum</hi> the gift of Indulgent Princes temporall power; this Law belongs to his ≈øecond or middle Crowne, this is already pleaded for, by our Prelates in print.</item>
                  <item>3. The≈øe two Crowne being already obtained, The Pope claimes, and makes the third him≈øelfe, and ≈øets it highe≈øt upon the top: This Crowne al≈øo hath its Law, and that is <hi>Ius Canonicum:</hi> This Canon Law is of more u≈øe unto his Pope≈øhip (if once admitted) than both the other.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Iu≈øt ≈øo our Prelates from the pretended Divinity of their Epi≈øcopacy, and from the temporall power gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by our Princes, would now obtrude a new Canon Law upon us: They have charged the Canons to the full, and never fearing they would requoyle into a Parliament, they have rammed a prodigious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Oath into them: the illegality and invalidity of the≈øe Canons, is manife≈øted by one ≈øhort que≈øtion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> what doe you call the meeting wherein they were made?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> who can frame an argument aright, unle≈ø≈øe he can tell again≈øt what he is to argue?</p>
               <p>Would you confute the Convocation-hou≈øe? they were a holy Synod; they were Commi≈ø≈øioners? will you di≈øpute their Commi≈ø≈øion? they will mingle all power together, and perhaps an≈øwer, they were ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe, that we neither knew nor imagined; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe they would unriddle them≈øelves, and owne what they were, wee may pro≈øecute non-concludent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have conferred with ≈øome of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of tho≈øe <hi>Canons,</hi> but I profe≈ø≈øe here, that I could never meet with any one of that a≈ø≈øembly, who could well an≈øwer to that fir≈øt que≈øtion of the Catechi≈øme, <hi>What is your name?</hi> Alas, they were parted before they knew what they were, when they were together.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:156910:72"/>
               <p>The ≈øumme of all the ≈øeverall an≈øwers that I have received, do all together amount unto this: They were a Convocationall, Synodicall A≈ø≈øembly of Commi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Indeed a threefold <hi>Chaemera,</hi> a Mon≈øter to our Lawes, a <hi>Cerberus</hi> to our Religion. A ≈øtrange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, where no Commi≈ø≈øioners name is to be found<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> A ≈øtrange Convocation that lived when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was dead. A ≈øtrange holy Synod, when the one part never ≈øaw nor conferred with the other.</p>
               <p>But indeed, there needed no conference, if it be true of the≈øe Cannons which I read of the former, <hi>Quis ne≈øcit, Canones Lambethae formari priu≈øquam in Synode ventilentur?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they have Innovated upon us; wee may ≈øay, it is <hi>Lex talionis</hi> to Innovate upon them, and ≈øo I hope we ≈øhortly ≈øhall doe.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, my humble motion is, that every member of that a≈ø≈øembly, who voted their Cannons, may come ≈øeverally to the Barre of this Hou≈øe, with a Book of Cannons in his hand and there unle≈ø≈øe he can an≈øwer that Catechi≈øme que≈øtion, as I called it, better then I expect he can, <hi>conceptis verbis,</hi> in ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øe termes as this honourable hou≈øe ≈øhall then think fit, he ≈øhall abjure his owne I≈ø≈øue, and be commanded to give fire to his owne Canons.</p>

               <p>The third is likewi≈øe con≈øiderable, as trenching upon the Crowne, which is that was ≈øaid under the Gallery, that Epi≈øcopacy was a third e≈øtate in Parliament, and therefore the King and Parliament could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. This I utterly deny, for there are three e≈øtates without them, as namely, the King, who is the fir≈øt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate; the Lords Temporall the ≈øecond, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the third; and I know no fourth e≈øtate. Be≈øides, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have had many Parliaments, wherein there have beene no Bi≈øhops at all: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.24 of his reigne held his Parliament at <hi>Edmundbury, exclu≈øo Clero;</hi> and in the Parliament 7. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. &amp; 7. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. it doth appeare, that they were enacted by the King, with the a≈ø≈øent and agreement of the Lords Temporall, and Commons, where the e≈øtates of Parliamen are mentioned, and not the Clergie. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ≈øtatutes might likewi≈øe be named to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, which I omit.</p>
               <p>The fourth and la≈øt thing is of the Bi≈øhops holding of the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Courts in their owne names, and not in the name of the King, nor by Commi≈ø≈øion from him, contrary to the Statute of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. and contrary to the practice of Bi≈øhop <hi>Ridley, Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and <hi>Ponnet,</hi> who tooke Commi≈ø≈øions from the <hi>KING</hi> for holding their Eccle≈øia≈øticall Courts, as may be ≈øeene at this day in the Rolles.</p>
               <p>And although it will be objected, that by a late Proclamation, in the yeare of our Lord God, 1637. wherein the opinion of the Iudges men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is declared upon their opinion, that the act of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. was repealed, and that Bi≈øhops may now keep Courts in their owne names, and ≈øend proce≈ø≈øe under their owne Seales; yet it is well knowne, that the Statute of 1 Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> which repealed the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. was it ≈øelfe repealed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 1 <hi>Iac. cap</hi> 25. Whereupon it was holden upon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:156910:75"/>a full debate of this poynt in Parliament, 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> which I have ≈øeene that upon con≈øideration of the Statutes of 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> and 1. <hi>Eliz. cap</hi> 1. and 8 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. that the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. was revived<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that Bi≈øhops ought not to keepe Courts in their owne names: So that for the≈øe rea≈øons ≈øo nearely concerning the right of the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> in the poynt of Epi≈øcopacy, I am again≈øt the propo≈øall of that que≈øtion, and am for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the <hi>London Petition,</hi> and for a thorow Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all abu≈øes, and grievances of Epi≈øcopacy mentioned in the Mini≈øters Remon≈øtrance, which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation may perhaps ≈øerve the turne without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> into a forme of Presbytery, as it is in other Kingdomes of <hi>Scotland, France, Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if notwith≈øtanding all the Reformation that can be made by the Lawes of this Land, a better forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may evidently appeare to us, concerning which there is no forme now before us; it is to be taken by us into con≈øideration, according to that imperiall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution in the≈øe words, <hi>In rebus nobis con≈øtituendis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens utilitas e≈ø≈øe debet, ut ab eo jure recedatur quod diu aequum vi≈øum e≈øt.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let it be our principall care that the≈øe wayes neither continue, nor returne upon us. If wee ≈øecure our Religion, wee ≈øhall cut off and defeat many Plots that are now on foot by Them and Others. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it Sir, Religion hath beene for a long time, and ≈øtill is the great de≈øigne upon this Kingdome. It is a knowne and practic'd principle, That they who would introduce another Religion into the Church, mu≈øt fir≈øt trouble and di≈øorder the government of the State, that ≈øo they may worke their ends, in a confu≈øion which now lyes at the doore.</p>
               <p>I come next Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to the Kings bu≈øine≈ø≈øe more particularly; which indeed is the Kingdomes, for one hath no exi≈øtence<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> no being without the other, their relation is ≈øo neere; yet ≈øome have ≈øtrongly and ≈øubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured a divorce, which hath beene the very band both of King and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>When foundations are ≈øhaken, it is high time to looke to the building. He hath no Heart, no Head, no Soule, that is not moved in his whole man, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, the mi≈øeries of the Common-wealth, that is not forward in all that he is, and hath, to redre≈ø≈øe them in a right way.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:156910:78"/>
               <p>The King likewi≈øe is reduced to great ≈øtraights, wherein it were undutifulne≈ø≈øe beyond inhumanity, to take advantage for him: let us rather make it an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for him, to doe him be≈øt ≈øervice when he hath mo≈øt need. Not to ≈øeeke our owne good, but in Him, and with Him, el≈øe wee ≈øhall commit the ≈øame crimes our ≈øelves, which wee mu≈øt condemne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>His Maje≈øty hath clearely and freely put him≈øelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and I pre≈øume, there is not a Man in this Hou≈øe, but feeles him≈øelfe advanc't in this high tru≈øt; but if Hee pro≈øper no better in our hands than he hath done in theirs, who have hitherto had the handling of his affaires, wee ≈øhall for ever make our ≈øelves unworthy of ≈øo gracious a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>I have often thought and ≈øaid, that it mu≈øt bee ≈øome great extremity, that would recover and certifie this ≈øtate, and when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>t extremity did come, <hi>Jt would be a great hazzard whether it might prove a remedy, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> We are now Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> upon that verticall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning poynt, and therefore it is no time to palliate, to foment our owne undoing.</p>
               <p>Let us ≈øet upon the remedy, wee mu≈øt fir≈øt know the Di≈øea≈øe: But to di≈øcover the de≈øea≈øes of the State, is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ≈øome) to traduce the Government; yet others are of opinion, that this is the halfe way to the Cure.</p>
               <p>His Maje≈øty is wi≈øer than they that have advi≈øed him, and therefore hee cannot but ≈øee and feele their ≈øubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting de≈øtructive Coun≈øells, which ≈øpeake lowder than I can ≈øpeak of them: for they ring a dolefull deadly knell over the whole Kingdome. His Maje≈øty be≈øt knowes who they are: for us, let the Matters bolt out the men; their actions di≈øcover them.</p>
               <p>They are men that talke largely of the Kings
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:156910:78"/>≈øervice, have done none but their owne, and that's too evident.</p>
               <p>They ≈øpeake highly of the Kings power, but they have made it a mi≈øerable power, that produceth nothing but weakne≈ø≈øe, both to the King and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>They have exhau≈øted the Kings revenew to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, nay through the bottome, and beyond.</p>
               <p>They have ≈øpent va≈øt ≈øummes of money wa≈øtefully, fruitle≈øly, dangerou≈øly: So that more money without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coun≈øells will be but a ≈øwift undoing.</p>
               <p>They have alwayes peremptorily pur≈øued one ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate pernicious cour≈øe. Fir≈øt, they bring things to an extremitie, then they make that extremity of their owne making, the rea≈øon of their next action, ≈øeven times wor≈øe than the former, and there wee are at this in≈øtant.</p>
               <p>They have almo≈øt ≈øpoyled the be≈øt in≈øtituted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, for Soveraignty in a King, liberty to the Subject; the proportionable temper of both which, makes the happie≈øt ≈øtate for power, for riches, for duration.</p>
               <p>They have unmannerly and ≈ølubbringly ca≈øt all their Projects, all their Machinations upon the King: which no wi≈øe or good Mini≈øter of State ever did, but would ≈øtill take all har≈øh, di≈øta≈øteful things upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, to cleare, to ≈øweeten their Ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>They have not ≈øuffered his Maje≈øtie to appeare unto his people, in his owne native goodne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>They have eclip≈øed him by their interpo≈øition: althogh gro≈ø≈øe conden≈øe bodies may ob≈øcure, and hinder the Sun from ≈øhining out, yet is hee ≈øtill the ≈øame in his owne ≈øplendor. And when they are removed, all Creatures under him are directed by his light, comforted by his beames: But they have framed a ≈øuper≈øtitious ≈øeeming Maxime of State for their owne turne; <hi>That if a King will ≈øuffer men to be torne from him, hee ≈øhall never have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:156910:79"/>any good ≈øervice done him.</hi> When the plaine truth is, that this is the ≈øure≈øt way to pre≈øerve a King from having ill ≈øervants ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They have among≈øt them an Apothegm of their owne making, which is, <hi>No Miter, no Scepter,</hi> when wee know by deare experience, that if the Mitre be once in danger, they care not to throw the Scepter after, to confound the whole Kingdome for their intere≈øt.</p>
               <p>And Hi≈øtories will tell us, that when≈øoever the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie went high, Monarchy ≈øtill went lower: If they could
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:156910:82"/>not make the Monarch the head of their owne Faction, they would be ≈øure to make him le≈ø≈øe: witne≈ø≈øe one example for all, The Popes working the Emperour out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of ours, as ≈øoone as they are Bi≈øhops <hi>adepto fine, ce≈ø≈øant Motus,</hi> They will preach no longer, their office then is to governe. But in my opinion they governe wor≈øe than they Preach, though they preach not at all; for wee ≈øee to what pa≈ø≈øe their government hath brought us.</p>
               <p>In conformity to them≈øelves, They ≈øilence others al≈øo, though <hi>Hierom</hi> in one of his Epi≈øtles ≈øaith, that even a Bi≈øhop, let him be of never ≈øo blamele≈ø≈øe a life, yet he doth more hurt by by his licence, then he can doe good by his example.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It now behooves us, to re≈øtraine the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops to the duties of their Function, as they may never more hanker after heterogeneous extravagant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Not be ≈øo ab≈øolute, ≈øo ≈øingle and ≈øolitary in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Moment, as Excommunication, Ab≈øolution, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the like: but to joyne ≈øome of the Mini≈øtry with them, and further to regulate them according to the u≈øage of Ancient Churches, in the be≈øt times, that by a well-temper'd Government, they may not have power hereafter, to corrupt the Church, to undoe the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>When they are thus circum≈øcribed, and the publique ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd from their Eruptions, then ≈øhall not I grudge them a liberall plentifull ≈øub≈øi≈øtence: el≈øe I am ≈øure they can nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> be given to Ho≈øpitality.</p>
               <p>Although the calling of the Clergie be all glorious within, yet if they have not a large, con≈øiderable, outward ≈øupport, they cannot be freed from vulgar Contempt.</p>
               <p>It will alwaies be fit, that the flouri≈øhing of the Church ≈øhould hold proportion with the flouri≈øhing of the Common-wealth, wherein it is. If we dwell in hou≈øes of Ceaar, why ≈øhould they dwell in skins? And I hope, I ≈øhall never ≈øee a good Bi≈øhop left wor≈øe than a Par≈øon without a Gleab.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:156910:82"/>
               <p>Certainly Sir, this ≈øuperintendencie of eminent men, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops over divers Churches, is the mo≈øt Primitive, the most ≈øpreading, the mo≈øt la≈øting Government of the Church. Wherefore while≈øt we are earne≈øt to take away Innovations, let us beware wee bring not in the greate≈øt Innovation that ever was in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doe very well know, what very many doe very ≈øervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øire. But let us well bethinke our ≈øelves, whether a popular Democraticall Government of the Church (though fit for other places) will be either ≈øutable or acceptable to a Regall, Monarchicall Government of the State.</p>
               <p>Every man can ≈øay, (It is ≈øo common and knowne a Truth) that ≈øuddaine and great changes both in naturall and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick bodies have dangerous opperations: and give mee leave to ≈øay, that we cannot pre≈øently ≈øee to the end of ≈øuch a con≈øequence, e≈øpecially in ≈øo great a Kingdome as this, and where Epi≈øcopacie is ≈øo wrap'd and involv'd in the Lawes of it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> my humble Motion is, that we may puni≈øh the pre≈øent offenders, reduce and pre≈øerve the Calling for better men hereafter. Let us remember with fre≈øh thankfulne≈ø≈øe to <hi>God,</hi> tho≈øe glorious Martyr-Bi≈øhops who were burn'd for our Religion in the times of Popery, who by their learning, zeale, and con≈øtancy, upheld and convey'd it downe to us.</p>
               <p>We have ≈øome good Bi≈øhops ≈øtill, who doe Preach every Lords Day, and are therefore worthy of double honour; they have ≈øuffered enough already in the Di≈øea≈øe: I ≈øhall bee ≈øorry we ≈øhould make them ≈øuffer more in the Remedy.</p>

               <p>I ≈øhall addre≈ø≈øe my≈øelfe to the body of his an≈øwere: Now give me leave my Lords, that I may open the nature of this great offence.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> it is a charge of Trea≈øon, which is a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon not ended, or expired by one ≈øingle Act; but a trade en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured by this Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> ever ≈øince the Kings favor hath been bestowed upon him.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it hath two parts: to deprive us that which was good. And ≈øecondly, to bring in a Tyrannicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it takes away the Lawes of the Land, and it hath an arbitrary government, bounded by no law, but what my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> plea≈øeth.</p>
               <p>It is the law, my Lords, which we reverence, and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully render to our gracious Soveraigne: The Law as it is the ground of our libertie, ≈øo it is the di≈øtribution of Iu≈øtice.</p>
               <p>My Lords, in all this, my Lord of Strafford hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make them uncapable of any benefit: it is true my Lords; that Trea≈øon again≈øt the per≈øon of a Prince is high Trea≈øon, and the highe≈øt Trea≈øon that can be to man; but it falls ≈øhort of this Trea≈øon against the State.</p>
               <p>When ble≈ø≈øed King <hi>Iames</hi> was taken to heaven, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the lawes to his ≈øonne, our gracious Soveraigne. But my Lords, if ≈øuch a de≈øign as this ≈øhould take effect, that the law of Iustice ≈øhouldbe taken from the Throne, we are without hope of ever ≈øeeing happy dayes: power is not ≈øo ea≈øily laid downe, unle≈ø≈øe it be by ≈øo good and ju≈øt a Prince as we have.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> accu≈øation is conveyed into twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:156910:98"/>eight Articles, and I ≈øhall but touch the heads, that wee ≈øhall in≈øi≈øt upon, and I thinke the be≈øt way to this, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider what he did before he went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> what then, and what ≈øince.</p>
               <p>He hath encroached juri≈ødiction where none was, taking upon him a power to repell the lawes, and to make new lawes, <hi>and in domineering over the lives and goods, and what ever el≈øe was the ≈øubjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, this he hath not done onely upon the meaner ≈øort, but upon the Peeres and auncient Nobilitie, and what may your Lord≈øhips expect, but the ≈øame mea≈øure at his hands here, as they have found there when he committed any to pri≈øon: if a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> were granted; the Officers mu≈øt not obey, and if any Fine were put upon the Officer, for refu≈øing them, there was a command that he ≈øhould bee di≈øcharged: ≈øo that he did not onely take power to him≈øelfe, but the Scepter of Iu≈øtice out of the Kings hand.</p>
               <p>When he was a member of the hou≈øe of Commons, it was his owne motion, all Mini≈øters of ≈øtate ≈øhould ≈øerve the King, according to the lawes which he hath broken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>He doth as much as ≈øay, that Fines ≈øhall not be payed by Officers, if in this they fulfill his commands, but tho≈øe that relea≈øe a pri≈øoner upon a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> ≈øhall finde his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure.</p>
               <p>My Lords, if this had been a ≈øingle Act, we ≈øhould not have accu≈øed him of high Trea≈øon, but this hath beene his common cour≈øe, and this we pre≈øent to your Lord≈øhips con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, that in the <hi>North</hi> the people atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Iu≈øtice, you ≈øhall ≈øee what a di≈øhonour he flung upon the ≈øacred Maje≈øtie of the King, that did advance him: ≈øome of the Iu≈øtices (≈øaith he) are all for Law, but they ≈øhall finde that the Kings little fingers is heavier then the Loynes of the Law.</p>
               <p>My Lords, what a ≈øad ≈øpeech was this, and what ≈øad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:156910:99"/>happened upon it, you all know, and he ≈øaid in a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ≈øpeech; <hi>That Ireland was a conquered Nation, and that the King might do with them what he would, their Charters were nothing worth, they did binde the King no longer then he plea≈øed. Surely you may ≈øee what hee would do if he had power, but we hope never ≈øuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell ≈øhall have acceptation in ≈øo gracious an Eare as our Soveraignes, and he doth not ≈øtay in words, but proceeds to Actions, when a Peere of the Kingdome was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Kingdome for ≈øuing at Law for recovering of his Right, he ≈øaith, he would have Ireland know that neither Law nor Lawyers ≈øhould que≈øtion any thing that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords, he goes higher, for when there was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion to ≈øpeake of an Act of State,</hi> he ≈øaid it ≈øhould bee as binding as an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>My Lords, <hi>he cannot goe higher then this, hee tells them in Parliament;</hi> they were a Conquered Nation, and they mu≈øt expect the u≈øage of a Conquered Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> Mountnorris <hi>for a few words that fell from his mouth ≈øpoken privately at his Table, had a Coun≈øell of warre called again≈øt him and was judged to death.</hi>

               <p>My Lords, <hi>it is no marvaile that he ≈øaie;</hi> That the Kings little finger ≈øhould be ≈øo heavie, when his little too was ≈øo heavie to tread downe a Peere under his foote.</p>
               <p>My Lords, <hi>he makes Lawes of him≈øelfe, and hee makes a difference in matters of Iu≈øtice betweene the poore and the rich, but when he hath executed his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the poore, he will fall upon the rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, <hi>he hath made that which was worth but five ≈øhillings to the value of twenty, and my</hi> Lords, <hi>by this he doth in effect take away what ere this commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is worth, he ≈øaith he doth it for the Kings gaine, but we ≈øhall make it appeare, that the Crowne hath lo≈øt, and he hath gained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the Commodity of Flax</hi> my Lords, <hi>it is but a

               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> my Lords, <hi>this Commondity he hath gotten wholly into his owne hands, for he made ≈øuch a Proclamation, that it ≈øhould be u≈øed in ≈øuch wayes as the Women could not doe it, and if it were not u≈øed in ≈øuch ways, that it ≈øhould bee ≈øei≈øed upon, no he doth not onely put impo≈øitions upon the Subject, but take away the goods too, and thus he hath levyed warre again≈øt the Kings Subjects, and this is his cour≈øe, that if a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree were made by him and not obeyed, there i≈ø≈øued a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to Souldiers, that they ≈øhould make Garri≈øon, and that they ≈øhould goe to the hou≈øes of tho≈øe that were pretended to be di≈øobedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords they have killed their ≈øheep and their Oxen, and bound their hor≈øes and took them Captives till they have rendered obedience, which is expre≈ø≈øely contrary to Law, for it ≈øaith;</hi> If any man ≈øet hor≈øe or foot upon the Kings Subject, in a Military way, it is high Trea≈øon.</p>
               <p>My Lords, <hi>it doth not onely oppre≈ø≈øe them in their e≈øtates, but provoke and incite his Maje≈øty to lay downe his mercy and goodne≈ø≈øe, and to fall into an offen≈øive war again≈øt his Subjects, and to ≈øay they are Rebels and Traytors.</hi>

               <p>I doe remember when the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was in great di≈øtre≈ø≈øe, after the great Battayle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> they gave thankes that the Coun≈øell did not de≈øpaire of the ≈øafety of the Common-wealth, and me thinkes there is no cau≈øe to de≈øpair, If tho≈øe ill Coun≈øels and ill ways have brought us to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, ≈øhall hereafter bee turned to wi≈øe, prudent and ≈øetled wayes, if God may ≈øo ble≈ø≈øe us that we again prove happy, for this Nation, the ≈øtrength and Scituation of it would hardly be brought to this condition, were it not for want of Vnity, and for di≈øcord among our ≈øelves.</p>

                  <hi>If God ≈øhall ble≈ø≈øe us and this whole Monarchy with unity, love and concord, certainly the≈øe great Armies that do now trouble us, and are ready to offend one an other, may ≈øhew a capability with united mindes and well de≈øigned to effect great matters, and may by unity of Coun≈øell rai≈øe us up againe in the world to a good e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and as great an honour as ever.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do fir≈øt pre≈øent my mo≈øt humble thanks to this Honourable A≈ø≈øembly, for this favour vouch≈øafed me, in granting me admittance to their pre≈øence, and doe humbly be≈øeech them to beleeve it is no de≈øire to pre≈øerve my ≈øelfe or my fortune, but to de≈øerve the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of tho≈øe that have drawne mee hither.</p>
               <p>I do profe≈ø≈øe in the pre≈øence of him that knoweth all hearts, that I had rather go from dore to dore, and crave <hi>Da obulum Belizario, &amp;c.</hi> with the good opinion of this A≈ø≈øembly, then live and enjoy all the honours and fortunes I am capable of.</p>
               <p>I doe not come hither with an intention to ju≈øtifie my words, my actions, or my opinions; but to make a plaine and cleare narration for my ≈øelfe, and then humbly to ≈øubmit to the wi≈øedome and ju≈øtice of this Hou≈øe my ≈øelfe, and all that concernes me.</p>
               <p>I doe well under≈øtand <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> with what di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage any man can ≈øpeake in his owne cau≈øe, and if I could have told how to have tran≈ømitted my thoughts and actions by a clearer repre≈øentation of another (I doe ≈øo much
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:156910:110"/>defie my owne judgement in working, and my wayes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing) that I ≈øhould have beene a mo≈øt humble ≈øuiter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have done it. But this Hou≈øe wil not take words, but with cleare and ingennous dealing, and therefore I ≈øhall be≈øeech them to think I come not hither with a ≈øet or ≈øtudied Speech, I come to ≈øpeake my heart, and to ≈øpeake it clearely and plainely, and then leave it to your clemencie and Ju≈øtice, and I hope if any thing ≈øhall ≈ølip from me, to work contrary to my meaning, or intention, di≈øorderly or ill placed, you will be plea≈øed to make a favourable con≈øtruction, and leave me the liberty of explanation, if there ≈øhall be any, but I hope there ≈øhall be no cau≈øe for it.</p>
               <p>I hope for my affection in Religion no man doubteth me, what my education, what and under whom for many yeares, is well knowne; I lived neere 30 yeares in the Society of <hi>Grayes Inn:</hi> and if one that was a reverend Preacher in my time (Doctor <hi>Sibbs</hi>) were now alive, hee were able to give te≈øtimony to this Hou≈øe, that when a party ill affected in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ≈øought to weary him, and tyer him out, hee had his chiefe≈øt encouragement from me.</p>
               <p>I have now <hi>(Master Speaker)</hi> been 15 yeares of the Kings Councell, from the fir≈øt houre to this minute, no man is able to ≈øay that ever I was Author, Advi≈øor, or Con≈øentor to any project.</p>
               <p>It plea≈øed the King (my gracious Ma≈øter) after I had ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him divers yeares to preferre mee to two places; to be chiefe Ju≈øtice of the Common Pleas, and then Keeper of his great Seale, I ≈øay it in the pre≈øence of God, I was ≈øo far from the thought of the one, and from the ambition of the other, that if my Ma≈øter his grace and goodne≈ø≈øe had not been, I had never enjoyed tho≈øe Honours.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> nor I doe not know what particulars there are that may draw me into your disfavour or ill opinion, and therefore I ≈øhall come very weakly armed, yet to tho≈øe that either in my owne knowledge, or by ≈øuch knowledge as is given me, and not from any in this Hou≈øe, I ≈øhall ≈øpeake ≈øomewhat, that I hope being truth, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:156910:110"/>with clearene≈ø≈øe and ingenuity, will at la≈øt procure ≈øome allay of that ill opinion which may perhaps be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I had once the Honour to ≈øit in the place that you doe: from the fir≈øt time I came thither, to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate time, I doe appeale to all that were here then, if I ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you not with candor. Ill office I never did to any of the Hou≈øe, good offices I have witne≈ø≈øes enough I did many, I was ≈øo happy that upon an occa≈øion which once happened, I received an expre≈ø≈øion and te≈øtimony of the good affection of this Hou≈øe towards me.</p>
               <p>For the la≈øt unhappy day I had a great ≈øhare in the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe and ≈øorrow of it. I hope there are enough doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no man within the walls of this Hou≈øe did expre≈ø≈øe more ≈øymptomes of ≈øorrow, griefe, and di≈øtraction then I did.</p>
               <p>After an adjournment for two or three dayes, it plea≈øed his Maje≈øtie to ≈øend for me, to let me know that he could not ≈øo re≈øolve of things as hee de≈øired, and therefore was de≈øirous that there might be an adjournment for ≈øome few dayes more. I prote≈øt I did not then di≈øcerne in his Maje≈øtie, and I beleeve it was not in his thoughts to think of the di≈ø≈øolving of this A≈ø≈øembly, but was plea≈øed in the fir≈øt place to give me a command to deliver his plea≈øure to the Hou≈øe for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment for ≈øome few dayes, till the Monday following, as I remember, and commanded me withall to deliver his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, that there ≈øhould be no further ≈øpeeches, but forth with upon the delivery of the Me≈ø≈øage come and wait upon him: hee likewi≈øe commanded me if que≈øtions were offered to be put, upon my Alleageance I ≈øhould not dare to doe it, how much I did then in all humblene≈ø≈øe rea≈øon with his Maje≈øtie, is not for me here to ≈øpeake; onely thus much let me ≈øay, I was no Author of any coun≈øell in it, I was onely a per≈øon in receiving commi≈ø≈øion. I ≈øpeake not this as any thing I now produce or doe invent, or take up for my owne excu≈øe, but that Which is knowne to divers, and ≈øome Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons in this hou≈øe to be mo≈øt true. All that I will ≈øay for that is humbly to be≈øeech you all to con≈øider, That if it had beene
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:156910:111"/>any mans cau≈øe as it was mine, betweene the di≈øplea≈øure of a gracious King, and the ill opinion of an Honourable A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. I be≈øeech you lay all together, lay my fir≈øt actions and behaviour with the la≈øt, I ≈øhall ≈øubmit to your Honourable and favourable con≈øtructions.</p>
               <p>For the Shipping bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, my opinion of that cau≈øe hath layne heavy upon me, I ≈øhall clearely and truly pre≈øent unto you what every thing is, with this prote≈øtation, that if in rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning up my owne opinion what I was of, or what I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, any thing of it be di≈øplea≈øing, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trary to the opinion of this Hou≈øe, that I am farre from ju≈øtifying of it, but ≈øubmit that and all other my actions to your wi≈øedomes and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> the fir≈øt Writs that were ≈øent out about Shipping bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, I had no more knowledge of it, and was as ignorant as any one Member of this Hou≈øe, or any man in the Kingdome. I was never the Author nor Advi≈øor of it, and will boldly ≈øay from the fir≈øt to this houre, I did never advi≈øe nor coun≈øell the ≈øetting forth of any Ship-writs in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> it is true that I was made chiefe Ju≈øtice of the Common Pleas ≈øome foure dayes before the Ship-writs went out to the Ports and Maritine places, as I doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the 20 of <hi>October</hi> 1634. they doe beare Te≈øte, and I was ≈øworne Ju≈øtice the 16 of <hi>October,</hi> ≈øo as they went out in that time, but without my knowledge or privity, the God of heaven knowes this to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> afterwards his Maje≈øtie was plea≈øed to command my Lord chiefe Ju≈øtice of the Kings Bench, that then was, Sir <hi>Thomas Richard≈øon,</hi> and chiefe Baron of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer that now is, and my ≈øelfe then chiefe Ju≈øtice of the Common Pleas, to take into con≈øideration the Pre≈øidents then brought unto us, which we did, and after returned to his Maje≈øtie what we had found out of tho≈øe Pre≈øidents.</p>
               <p>It is true, that afterwards his Maje≈øtie did take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration, that if the whole Kingdome were concerned, that it was not rea≈øon to lay the whole burthen upon the Cinque Ports and Maritine Townes.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:156910:111"/>
               <p>Thereupon, upon what ground his Maje≈øty took that into his con≈øideration, I doe confe≈ø≈øe I doe know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>His Maje≈øty did command my Lord chief Ju≈øtice that now is, my Lord chiefe Baron, and my ≈øelfe, to returne our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whether, when the whole Kingdome is in danger, and the Kingdome in generall is concerned, it be not according to Law and rea≈øon, that the whole Kingdome, and his Maje≈øtie, and all intere≈ø≈øed therein, ≈øhould joyne in defending and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving thereof.</p>
               <p>This was in time, about one 1634.</p>
               <p>In Michaelmas Terme following, his Maje≈øty commanded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e to goe to all the Judges, and require their opinions in particular.</p>
               <p>He commanded mee to doe it to every one, and to charge them upon their duty and allegiance, to keepe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>t ≈øecret.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> it was never intended by his Maje≈øty (≈øo profe≈ø≈øed by him) at that time, and ≈øo declared to all the Judges, that it was not required by him, to be ≈øuch a binding opinion to the Subject, as to hinder him from calling it in que≈øtion, nor to be binding to them≈øelves, but that upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rea≈øon, and advi≈øe they may alter it; but de≈øired their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, for his owne private rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>I know very well, that extrajudiciall opinions of Judges ought not to be binding.</p>
               <p>But I did think, and ≈øpeake my heart and con≈øcience free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; my ≈øelfe, and the re≈øt of the Judges being ≈øworne, and by our Oaths tyed to coun≈øell the King when he ≈øhould require advi≈øe of us, that we were bound by our oaths and duties to returne our opinions.</p>
               <p>I did obey his Maje≈øties command, and doe here before the God of heaven avow it.</p>
               <p>I did never u≈øe the lea≈øt promi≈øe of preferment or reward to any, nor did u≈øe the lea≈øt menacy; I did leave it freely to their owne con≈øciences and liberty; for I was left the liberty of my owne by his Maje≈øty, and had rea≈øon to leave them the liberty of their owne con≈øciences.</p>
               <p>And I be≈øeech you be plea≈øed to have ≈øome beliefe, that I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:156910:112"/>would not ≈øay this, but that I know the God of heaven will make it appeare; and I be≈øeech you that extravagant ≈øpeeches may not move again≈øt that which is a po≈øitive and cleare truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> in the di≈øcour≈øe of this (as is betweene Judges, ≈øome ≈ømall di≈øcour≈øes ≈øometimes) yet never any cau≈øe wherein any Judges conferred, that were ≈øo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as between me and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> again≈øt a Negative, I can ≈øay nothing, but I ≈øhall affirme nothing unto you, but by the grace of God, as I affirme it to be true, ≈øo I make no doubt of making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be ≈øo.</p>
               <p>This opinion was ≈øub≈øcribed without Solicitation, there was not any man of us did make any doubt of ≈øub≈øcribing our opinion, but two, Ma≈øter Ju≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Ma≈øter Iu≈øtice <hi>Crooke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ma≈øter Iu≈øtice <hi>Crooke</hi> made not a ≈øcruple of the thing, but of the introduction, for it was thus:</p>
               <p>That whereas the Ports &amp; the Maritine Towns were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; there according to the Pre≈øidents in former times, the charge lay on them.</p>
               <p>So when the Kingdome was in danger, of which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty was the ≈øole Iudge; whether it was not agreeable to Law and rea≈øon, the whole Kingdome to beare the charge;</p>
               <p>I left this ca≈øe with Iudge <hi>Crooke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Terme I ≈øpake with him, hee could give me no re≈øolution, becau≈øe hee had not ≈øeene the Writs in former times, but did give his opinion, that when the whole Kings dome was in danger, they of the defence ought to be borne by all.</p>
               <p>So of that opinion of his, there was no need of a Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation.</p>
               <p>I ≈øpeake no more here, than I did openly in my argument in the Chequer Chamber.</p>
               <p>This is the naked truth: for Ma≈øter Iu≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> he did never ≈øub≈øcribe at all.</p>
               <p>I will onely ≈øay this, that I was ≈øo farre from pre≈ø≈øing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:156910:112"/>him to give his opinion, becau≈øe he did ask time to con≈øider of it, that I will boldly ≈øay, and make it good, that when his Maje≈øty would have had him ≈øometimes ≈øent for, to give his opinion, I be≈øeeched his Maje≈øty to leave him to him≈øelfe and his con≈øcience; and that was the ill office I did.</p>
               <p>The Iudges did ≈øub≈øcribe in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> 1635.</p>
               <p>I had no conference (nor truly I think) by accident any di≈øcour≈øe with any of the Iudges touching their opinions; for till <hi>February</hi> 1636, there was no ≈øpeech of it, for when they had delivered their opinions, I did returne according to my duty to my Ma≈øter the King, and delivered them to him: in who≈øe cu≈øtody they be in.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February</hi> 1636, upon a command that came from his Maje≈øty, by one of the then Secretaries of State, the Iudges all a≈ø≈øembled in <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> we did then fall into a debate of the ca≈øe then ≈øent unto us, and wee did then returne our opinion unto his Maje≈øty; there was then much di≈øcour≈øe and great debate about it.</p>
               <p>Mine opinion and con≈øcience at that time was agreeable to that opinion <hi>I</hi> then delivered.</p>
               <p>I did u≈øe the be≈øt arguments <hi>I</hi> could, for the maintainance of my opinion; and that was all <hi>I</hi> did.</p>
               <p>It is true that then at that time, Ma≈øter Iu≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Ma≈øter Ju≈øtice <hi>Crooke</hi> did not differ in the maine point, which was this;</p>
               <p>When the Kingdome was in danger, the charge ought to be borne by the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But in this point, whether the King was the ≈øole Judge of the danger? they differed.</p>
               <p>So as there was betweene the fir≈øt ≈øub≈øcription, and this debate, and con≈øultation, ≈øome 15 moneths difference.</p>
               <p>It is true, that all of them did then ≈øub≈øcribe, both Ju≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Ju≈øtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> which was returned to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øtie, and after publi≈øhed by my Lord Keeper (my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øour) in the Star-chamber.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:156910:113"/>leave it to tho≈øe, who≈øe memories wil call to mind what was then done.</p>
               <p>The rea≈øon of the ≈øub≈øcription of Iu≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> (though they differed in opinion) grew from this that was told them, from the re≈øt of the Iudges,</p>
               <p>That where the greater number did agree in their vote, the re≈øt were involved and included.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> among the re≈øt (according to my duty) <hi>I</hi> argued the ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall not trouble you, to tell you what my argument was, I pre≈øume there are Copies enough of it; onely I will tell you there are foure things, very briefly, what I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, concerning the matter of danger, and nece≈ø≈øity of the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>I profe≈ø≈øe that there was never a Judge in the Kingdome did deliver an opinion, but that it mu≈øt be in a ca≈øe of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant danger.</p>
               <p>When we came to an argument of the ca≈øe, it was not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a matter or i≈ø≈øue, but it was upon a demurrer.</p>
               <p>Whether the danger was ≈øufficiently admitted in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore was not the thing that was in di≈øpute, that was the fir≈øt degree and ≈øtep that led unto it.</p>
               <p>I did deliver my ≈øelfe as free and as cleare as any man did, that the King ought to governe by the po≈øitive Lawes of the Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that hee could not alter nor change, nor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in matters of Law, but by common con≈øent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I did further deliver, that if this were u≈øed to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revenue or benefit to the King, or in any other way but in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, and for the pre≈øervation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:156910:113"/>The judgement did warrant no ≈øuch thing:</p>
               <p>My opinion in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, I did in my conclu≈øion of my argument ≈øubmit to the judgement of this Hou≈øe.</p>
               <p>I never delivered my opinion, that mony ought to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, but Ships provided for the defence of this Kingdome, and in that the Writ was performed.</p>
               <p>And that the charge ought not to be in any ca≈øe, but where the whole Kingdome was in danger.</p>
               <p>And Ma≈øter Ju≈øtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Ma≈øter Iu≈øtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> were of the ≈øame opinion with me.</p>
               <p>I doe humbly ≈øubmit, having related unto you my whole carriage in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, humbly ≈øubmitting my ≈øelfe to your grave and favourable cen≈øures, be≈øeeching you not to think that I delivered the≈øe things with the lea≈øt intention to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or ≈øubject the common Law of the Kingdome, or to bring in, or to introduce any new way of government, it hath bin farre from my thoughts, as any thing under the heavens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I have heard too that there hath bin ≈øome ill opinion conceived of me about Forre≈øt bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, which was a thing farre out of the way of my ≈øtudy, as any thing I know towards the Law.</p>
               <p>But it plea≈øed his Maje≈øty, in the ≈øickne≈ø≈øe of Ma≈øter <hi>Noy,</hi> to give ≈øome ≈øhort warning to prepare my ≈øelfe for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>When I came there, I did both the King and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth acceptable ≈øervice, for I did and dare be bold to ≈øay, with extreame danger to my ≈øelfe and fortune, (≈øome doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand my meaning herein) run through that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and left the Forre≈øt as much as was there.</p>
               <p>A thing in my judgement con≈øiderable for the advantage of the Common-wealth, as could be undertaken.</p>
               <p>When I went downe about that imployment, I ≈øatisfied my ≈øelfe about the matter of perambulation.</p>
               <p>There were great difficulties of opinions, what perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was.</p>
               <p>I did arme my ≈øelfe as well as I could, before I did any thing in it,</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:156910:114"/>
               <p>I did acquaint tho≈øe that were then Iudges, in the pre≈øence of the noble Lords, with ≈øuch objections as <hi>I</hi> thought it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to offer unto them.</p>
               <p>If they thought they were not objections of ≈øuch waight, as were fit to ≈øtirre them, <hi>I</hi> would not doe the King that di≈ø≈øervice.</p>
               <p>They thought the objections had ≈øuch an≈øwers as might well induce the like upon a conference with the whole Country, admitting mee to come and conferre with them, the Country did unanimou≈øly ≈øub≈øcribe.</p>
               <p>It fell out afterwards, that the King commanded me, and all this before <hi>I</hi> was chiefe Iu≈øtice, to goe into <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and did then tell me he had beene enformed, that the bounds of the Forre≈øt were narrower, then in truth they ought to be; and <hi>I</hi> did according to his command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will here profe≈ø≈øe that which is knowne to many, <hi>I</hi> had no thought or intention of enlarging the bounds of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt, further then <hi>H.</hi> and that part about it, for which there was a perambulation about 26 <hi>Edward</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> de≈øired the Country to confer with me about it, if they were plea≈øed to doe it; and then according to my duty, <hi>I</hi> did produce tho≈øe Records which <hi>I</hi> thought fit for his Maje≈øties ≈øervice, leaving them to di≈øcharge them≈øelves as by Law and Ju≈øtice they might doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> did never in the lea≈øt kind, goe about to overthrow the charter of the Forre≈øt.</p>
               <p>And did publi≈øh and maintaine <hi>Charta de Fore≈øta,</hi> as a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thing, and no man to violate it, and ought to be pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the King and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> doe in this humbly ≈øubmit, and what <hi>I</hi> have done, to the goodne≈ø≈øe and Ju≈øtice of this Hou≈øe.</p>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:156910:119"/>of ≈øummes of money mu≈øt find it privately: and I feare the ≈øame of Silver; for, ob≈øerving the ≈øpecies of late Coyning, many halfe Crownes were ≈øtamped which are no more to be ≈øeene; and by this mea≈øure I conclude the Kingdome growes poore.</p>
               <p>The cau≈øes of this decay of Money may be many: It may be ≈øtolne out for profit, going much higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas, e≈øpecially in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much hath been drawn away by the Stranger upon feares of our Troubles, of which I have experience by Exchanges, and Exchanges are the great my≈øtery, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ≈øuch as are u≈øed as a Trade, and governed by Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who make many returnes in a yeare, and gaine by every one more then the intere≈øt of a yeare; and the greate≈øt danger to a State is, <hi>when money is made Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, which ≈øhould be but the mea≈øure thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I will propo≈øe a Probleme, Whether it were profitable to a Kingdome or not, that the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for many yeares had a great ≈øtock here at intere≈øt, and ≈øtill hath ≈øome. I confe≈ø≈øe it hath ≈øupplyed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities of Merchants, and helped to drive Trade: But my <hi>Quaere</hi> is this, Suppo≈øe the fir≈øt principall were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in by the Stranger, yet, doubling every tenne yeares, what becomes of the increa≈øe? Have they not lived by our Trade and the Merchant-adventurers, and ≈øoaked the Kingdome of as many times princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall as they have practi≈øed this U≈øury many times ten yeares, and in the end drawne or carried all away? This is a point to a State very con≈øiderable.</p>
               <p>Much Coyne hath beene drawne away without doubt by the <hi>French,</hi> who have brought in Wares of little bulke, perhaps without cu≈øtome, but of deare price; and having turned them into Gold, have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without inve≈øting any part thereof; and ≈øuch petty Merchants cannot bee reached by the Statute of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:156910:119"/>
               <p>Another cau≈øe of ≈øcarcity of Coine may be the over ≈øtrict rule of the uncurrentne≈ø≈øe of any good Coine, and that it mu≈øt bee ≈øold here as bullion: in that ca≈øe what Stranger will bring in money? <hi>Whereas, if every good ≈øpecies were current according to his allay and weight in proportion to our Coyne, or rather a little higher, it would draw (namely) money by degrees into England, as lower grounds doe water from higher, though they ≈øee not the Channels. And wee ≈øee France, Holland, and Germany, admit all good Coynes, though forraigne, for and above their intrin≈øique value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will end this ≈øearch by propo≈øing ≈øome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Remedies, for I doe now but make E≈ø≈øayes and give occa≈øion to more ≈øubtill and particular di≈øqui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To the fir≈øt leake of ≈øteading away Coyne, I would make it felony by an Act: for if a man may justly ≈øuffer death for robbing of a private man, I ≈øee no inju≈øtice nor cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to inflict the ≈øame puni≈øhment upon him that robs a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the neighbour Princes and States doe cry up our money, and ≈øo entice it from us, This in my judgement ought to be provided for by our Treaties, which was the old way, e≈øpecially of Commerce, by agreeing and publi≈øhing of Placarts according to a true Par: For that Prince that will make a treatie of Commerce, doth it for the u≈øe of the commoditie; which certainly I would deny any Prince that would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to keep moneyes even by their true values, at lea≈øt, that would ≈øet a higher price upon our money then the King hath done: And if our Coyne did either keep beyond the Sear the Engli≈øh value, or were bullion and uncurrent, the ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ≈øhould have as little of our money, as we have of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How to recover the ≈øtrangers money, drawne away ≈øince our troubles, is a hard endeavour, and can no wayes be brought to pa≈ø≈øe but by peace and Trade: and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:156910:120"/>the re≈øolution of this will fall into the generall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which I ≈øhall propo≈øe.</p>
               <p>The pedling <hi>French</hi> Trade mu≈øt bee met with by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ≈øearch at the landing of the≈øe <hi>Creamers,</hi> what they bring in, and by ≈øuffering none of them to pa≈ø≈øe any goods by private Warrants: but that according as they ≈øhall be valued, they give bond to inve≈øt it in <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Commoditie, naturall, or naturalized, and that with ≈øurety: <hi>Nay in this Ca≈øe not to allow them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by bills; for it will not hurt the Common-wealth if by any rigour they were beaten out of their private toyi≈øh traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ≈øhall not doubt to offend any but the Mint, which may be recompenced to his Maje≈øty in his cu≈øtomes, if money bee plentifull; for all goods will follow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. If I did propo≈øe the currentne≈ø≈øe of all goods, and great ≈øpecies of forraigne Coins, for their true intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øique value, according to the pay with ours, and if I ≈øay a little higher, according to occa≈øions, keeping our owne Coine pure and con≈øtant to bee cryed downe as much under according to occa≈øions, I thinke it will bee a policy both rea≈øonable and profitable, by experience tryed in other States.</p>
               <p>But leaving the≈øe Empiricall practi≈øes, I come now to the great and infallible Rule and Remedy, which is, in plaine Engli≈øh, to ≈øettle and a≈ø≈øure the ground of Trade upon ≈øtaple Commodities; then, like the Lady of <hi>Whit≈øontide</hi> to her Pipe, money will dance after that; for as Merchandize doth follow money, ≈øo doth money Commodity.</p>
               <p>I ≈øaid at fir≈øt, it was a generall opinion, that Trade never flouri≈øhed more then now, and it may be ≈øo; but wee mu≈øt con≈øider this be not accidentall and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and depending more upon the iniquity or mi≈øery of the times, then upon our owne Foundation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry; and if that bee ≈øo, then it is no ≈øute ground for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:156910:120"/>a ≈øtate to rely upon; for if the cau≈øes change, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will follow.</p>
               <p>Now it is true, that our great Trade depends upon the troubles of our Neighbours, and wee enjoy almo≈øt the Trade of Chri≈øtendome; but if a peace happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and the united Provinces, all the≈øe will ≈øhare what wee now po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe alone, and therefore wee mu≈øt provide for that day; for nothing ≈øtands ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but upon his owne foundation.</p>
               <p>To make then our owne Trade ≈øecure, wee mu≈øt con≈øider our own ≈øtaple commodities<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whereof Wooll is the chiefe≈øt, and ≈øeeke the way to both, to keepe up the price at home, and the e≈øtimation of all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made of that, and to be vented abroad.</p>
               <p>Some other helpes we have, as Tynne Lead, and ≈øuch like; but I dare confidently affirme, <hi>That nothing expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our owne growth hath ballanced our Riotous con≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption at home, but tho≈øe forraigne commodities, which I call naturalized, that is, that ≈øurplus of our Ea≈øt-India Trade, which being brought home in greater quantity then are ≈øpent within the Kingdome, are exported againe, and become in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and u≈øe as naturall commodities and therfore by the way, I hold it ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to maintaine that Trade by a Regulation with the Dutch; of which more rea≈øon ≈øhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when that particular ≈øhall be taken into con≈øideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have yet another great helpe which is our owne, and wants onely our indu≈øtry to gather the harve≈øt, which is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We have one helpe more, if we knew how to u≈øe it, <hi>that is, by the new drained Lands in the Fens, mo≈øt fit for Flax and Hempe, to make all ≈øorts of Linnen for the body, for the hou≈øe, and ≈øayles for ≈øhips, that is a</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Trade; but in</hi> Holland <hi>one Acre of Ground is rented at three pounds, which if the</hi> Hollanders <hi>may have in the Fens for</hi> 10. <abbr>s.</abbr>

                  <hi>it will bee ea≈øie to draw the manufacture into England, which will ≈øet infinite people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, and we may be able to ≈øerve other Nations with that which we buy deare from them,</hi> and then the ≈øtate and Kingdome will be happy and rich, when the Kings cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomes ≈øhall depend upon commodities exported, and tho≈øe able to returne all things which wee want; and then our money mu≈øt ≈øtay within our Kingdome, and all the trade returne in money. To incourage you to this, I give you one Example,</p>
               <p>That, if the ≈øeverall ≈øorts of <hi>Callicoes,</hi> made of <hi>Cotton-Woolls</hi> in the <hi>Moguls</hi> and <hi>Dans</hi> Dominions, doth cloathe from head to foot all <hi>A≈øia,</hi> a part of <hi>Europe, Aegypt,</hi> much of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the <hi>Ea≈øterne I≈ølands</hi> as farre as <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi> which makes that Prince without Mines the riche≈øt Prince in the world; by his Maje≈øties Grace and Priviledges granted to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I am confident wee may make an under≈øell in all Linnen cloath in all the Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have now wandred far from my Theme, which was the decay of Trade and of Woollen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
               <p>I mu≈øt fir≈øt therefore pre≈øent to your con≈øideration the cau≈øes thereof in my ob≈øervations; whereof ≈øome are internall, and ≈øome externall.</p>
               <p>The internall have proceeded from her owne fal≈øe making, as ≈øtretching, and ≈øuch like practi≈øes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indeed our Cloath is di≈øcredited: I ≈øpeake by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:156910:121"/>from <hi>Dan≈øick</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> Northward, to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople;</hi> as I will in≈øtance in due time.</p>
               <p>This fal≈øe Lucre of our owne, and the interruption in the dying and dre≈øsing (projected and not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come) gave the fir≈øt wound, though, could it have been compa≈ø≈øed, it had doubled the value of our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>This hath cau≈øed the <hi>Dutch, Sile≈øians</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> to attempt the making of Cloath, and now, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (as I am informed) <hi>the halfe is not vented, that was in the former Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another internall cau≈øe hath ri≈øen from ≈øuch Impo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as hath made our cloth too deare abroad, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taught others to provide for them≈øelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another internall cau≈øe hath ≈øprung from pre≈ø≈øaries upon tender Con≈øciences, that many of our Clothiers and others have for≈øaken the Kingdome, and carried their Arts with them, to the unexpre≈ø≈øible detriment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The externall cau≈øes have beene the want of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and countenance to our Merchants e≈øtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed abroad in Factories by the State and by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby the Capitulations have not beene kept nor a≈ø≈øured unto them, neither in <hi>Pru≈ø≈øia,</hi> nor in the <hi>Sound,</hi> nor <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> nor <hi>Holland,</hi> nor in the Ea≈øt: And this I dare ≈øay, <hi>that Laban never changed Jacobs wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ≈øo often as the Hollanders have forced our Merchants to change their re≈øidences,</hi> and the very cour≈øe of this Trade by Lawes and Tricks for their own advantage; of which the Merchant-adventurers will more fully informe you.</p>
               <p>Another externall cau≈øe is lamentable, <hi>Report, the increa≈øe of the Pyrates, and the in≈øecurity of the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Seas; whereby Bri≈øtow and the We≈øterne Ports, that cannot have ≈øo great ≈øhipping as</hi> London, are beaten out of Trade and fi≈øhing: and if once tho≈øe Theeves ≈øhall find
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:156910:122"/>the way to Banke and new-found Land, they will undoe the We≈øt parts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will trouble you with a Con≈øideration very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable in our Government, Whether indeed <hi>London</hi> doth not monopolize all Trade. In my opinion it is no good ≈øtate of a body to have a fat Head, thin Guts, and leane Members.</p>
               <p>But to bring ≈øomething before you of Remedy, I ≈øay thus for my fir≈øt ground, That if our Cloth be not vented as in former yeares, let us imbrace ≈øome other way to ≈øpend and vent our Wools. Cloth is a heavy and hot wearing, and ≈øerves but one cold corner of the World: But if we imbrace the new Draperies, and encourage the Wallons and others, by Priviledges and Naturalizations, wee ≈øhall imploy all the wooll wee have, ≈øet more people a worke then by Cloth, and a pound of wooll in tho≈øe ≈øtuffes true made, will out-≈øell two pounds in Cloth. <hi>And thus wee may ≈øupply France, Italy, Spain, Barbary, and ≈øome parts of A≈øia, by ≈øuch light and fine ≈øtuffes as will fit tho≈øe warmen Regions, and et have ≈øufficient for the cold Clymates to be ≈øpent and adventured in true made Cloth, by the reputation both of our Nation and commodity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this cour≈øe, I mu≈øt ob≈øerve, that the≈øe ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ≈øo fit to be nouri≈øhed, and being Prote≈øtants, may have priviledges to u≈øe their owne rights in Religion, ≈øo as they be not ≈øcandalous, as the Dutch and French had granted unto them by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ≈øetling of Religion ≈øecure in <hi>England,</hi> the feare whereof made many weake minds to waver and abandon this Countrey, is, and will be a great meanes to re≈øettle both the great and le≈ø≈øer manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of woollen commodities.</p>
               <p>For the externall cau≈øes, wee mu≈øt flye to the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of his Maje≈øties gracious goodne≈ø≈øe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, who, I am confident, when the whole bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:156910:122"/>≈øhall be prepared for him, and that we have ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him our duty and love and ≈øettled his cu≈øtoms in ≈øuch a bountifull way as hee may reape his part of the fruit of Trade; I am confident, I ≈øay, that he will vouch≈øafe you all favour fit to be conferred upon good Subjects, and not onely protect you abroad by his forces and authority, and by treaties with his neighbours, but by increa≈øing the priviledges of Merchants at home, and confirming all their Charters; the breach whereof hath beene a great di≈øcouragement unto them, and without which duely ob≈øerved, they cannot regulate their Trade.</p>
               <p>There are ≈øome particulars in the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Trade, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps worthy of animadver≈øion, as under-≈øelling good commodity to make money, or barter for Tobacco, to the imba≈øement of our owne Staple for Smoake, which in a due place ought to bee taken into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation.</p>
               <p>Another con≈øideration for a ground for Trade, ought to be the nature of it, with whom, and for what wee trade, and which Trade is more principally to bee nouri≈øhed, which, out of doubt, are the <hi>Northern</hi> Trades, which are the root of all other, becau≈øe the materials brought from tho≈øe parts, as from <hi>Wx, Mu≈øcove, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Pru≈ø≈øia,</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> are fundamentall and of ab≈øolute nece≈øsity; for from the≈øe Trades we get the materials of Shipping, as Pitch, Tarre, Cordage, Ma≈øts, and ≈øuch like, which inable us to all the <hi>Southerne</hi> Trades of them≈øelves, of le≈ø≈øe u≈øe, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wine, Fruit, Oranges and Curio≈øities for Sauces or effeminacy; but by the≈øe, we ≈øayle to the Ea≈øt-Indies, and may erect a Company of the We≈øt-Indies, for the golden fleece, which ≈øhall bee prepared for you, when≈øoever you are ready for ≈øo great a Con≈øultation.</p>

I have given you but E≈ø≈øayes, and ≈øtrooke little ≈øparkes of fire before you. <hi>My intention is but to provoke the wit and ability of others; I have drawn you a Map, wherein you cannot ≈øee things clearely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctly, onely I introduce matter before you: and now I have done, when I have ≈øhewed you the way how to enlarge and bring every particular thing into debate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which end, my motion and de≈øire is this, That we may ≈øend to every ≈øeverall Company of Merchants trading in Companies, and under Government and Priviledges, and to aske of them, what is their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in their generall Trade (not to rake into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Complaints, what are the cau≈øes of decay or abu≈øes in their Trades, and of the want of money, which is vi≈øible and of the great lo≈ø≈øes, both to the Kingdome and to every particular, by the late high exchanges; and to de≈øire every one of the≈øe Companies to ≈øet downe their judgement in writing to the Committee by a day appointed; and having from them all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ≈øtate of the complaints ≈øeverally, we ≈øhall make ≈øome judgements of the≈øe relations one to another this done I de≈øire to require all the ≈øame ≈øeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, upon their owne papers, to propo≈øe to us in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Remedies appliable in their judgement; which materials having all together, and comparing one with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:156910:123"/>another we ≈øhall di≈øcover that truth which we ≈øeeke; that is, whether Trade and Money decay or not, and how to remedy it.</p>
               <p>But I have one reque≈øt more and ≈øo I will ea≈øe you of my lo≈ø≈øe of your time: That when from all the≈øe Merchants we ≈øhall have before us ≈øo much matter and without ≈øuch variety and perhaps not without private and partiall ends, that then you will give me leave to repre≈øent to you the names of ≈øome generall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers di≈ø-intere≈ø≈øed and wel experienced in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, who may a≈ø≈øi≈øt our judgements in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øes, particularly in moneys and exchanges, and give us great light to prepare our re≈øult and re≈øolution to bee by the whole Hou≈øe of Commons repre≈øented to his Maje≈øty, and for expedition, that a ≈øub-Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, may be named to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this Information from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>

                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> a little ≈øearch will ≈øerve to find them to have beene the de≈øtruction of unitie; under pretence of uniformity, to have brought in ≈øuper≈øtition and ≈øcandall; under the titles of reverence and decency, to have defil'd our Church; by adorning our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to have ≈ølackned the ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe of that union which was formerly betweene us and tho≈øe of our religion beyond the ≈øea; an action as unpoliticke as ungodly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> wee ≈øhall finde them to have Tith'd Mint and Ani≈øe, and have left undone the weightier works of the Law; to have been le≈ø≈øe eager upon tho≈øe who damne our Church, then upon tho≈øe who, upon weake con≈øcience, and perhaps as weake rea≈øons (the di≈ølike of ≈øome commanded garment, or ≈øome uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded po≈øture) onely ab≈øtained from it. Nay, it hath been more dangerous for men to goe to ≈øome neighbours Pari≈øh, when they had no ≈øermon in their owne, then to be ob≈øtinate and perpetuall Recu≈øants; while Ma≈ø≈øes have been ≈øaid in ≈øecurity, a conventicle
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:156910:124"/>hath beene a crime, and which is yet more, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to ceremonies hath beene more exacted then the conforming to Chri≈øtianity; and while≈øt men for ≈øcruples have beene undone, for attempts upon <hi>Sodomie</hi> they have onely beene admoni≈øhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> we ≈øhall find them to have beene like the hen in <hi>E≈øop,</hi> which laying every day an egge upon ≈øuch a proportion of barly, her Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing her proportion in hope ≈øhee would encrea≈øe her egges, ≈øhee grew ≈øo fat upon that addition, that ≈øhee never laid more: ≈øo though at fir≈øt their preaching were the occa≈øion of their preferment, they after made their preferment the occa≈øion of their not preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> we ≈øhall find them to have re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled another fable, the dog in the manger; to have neither preached them≈øelves, nor employ'd tho≈øe that ≈øhould, nor ≈øuffered tho≈øe that would: to have brought in catechi≈øing only to thru≈øt out preaching, cryed downe Lectures by the name of Factions, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe their indu≈øtry in that duty appeared a reproofe to their neglect of it, (not unlike to that we read of him, who in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time and <hi>Tacitus</hi> his ≈øtory was accu≈øed, becau≈øe by his vertue he did appeare <hi>Exprobrare vitia Principis</hi>) or with intention to have brought in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, that they might the ea≈øier ≈øow their tares, while it was night; and by that introduction of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, introduce the better that Religion which accompts it the Mother of devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> in this they have abu≈øed his Maje≈øty, as well as his people, for when they had with great wi≈øedome (≈øince u≈øually the children of darkne≈ø≈øe are wi≈øer in their generation then the children of light; I may gue≈ø≈øe not without ≈øome eye upon the mo≈øt politicke action of the mo≈øt politicke Church) ≈øilenced on both parts tho≈øe opinions which have often tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

And it is ob≈øervable, that that party to which they gave this licence, was that who≈øe doctrine, though it were not contrary to law, was contrary to cu≈øtome, and for a long while in this Kingdome was no oftner preached then recanted.</p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> that as ≈øome ill Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters in our ≈øtate fir≈øt tooke away our mony from us, and after indeavoured to make our mony not worth the taking, by turning it into bra≈ø≈øe by a kind of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphilo≈øophers-≈øtone:</hi> ≈øo the≈øe men u≈øed us in the point of preaching, fir≈øt depre≈øsing it to their power, and next labouring to make it ≈øuch, as the harme had not beene much, if it had beene depre≈ø≈øed, the mo≈øt frequent ≈øubjects even in the mo≈øt ≈øacred auditories, being the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Bi≈øhops and tithes, the ≈øacredne≈ø≈øe of the clergie, the ≈øacriledge of impropriations, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli≈øhing of puritani≈øme and propriety, the building of the prerogative at <hi>Pauls,</hi> the introduction of ≈øuch doctrines, as, admitting them true, the truth would not recompence the ≈øcandall; or of ≈øuch as were ≈øo far fal≈øe, that, as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> ≈øayes of the Ca≈øui≈øts, their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe was not to keepe men from ≈øinning, but to enforme them <hi>Quam prop√®<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ad peccatum ≈øine peccato liceat accedere:</hi> ≈øo it ≈øeemed their worke was to try how much of a Papi≈øt might bee brought in without Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to de≈øtroy as much as they could of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, without bringing them≈øelves into danger of being de≈øtroyed by the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> to goe yet further, ≈øome of them have ≈øo indu≈øtriou≈øly laboured to deduce them≈øelves from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they have given great ≈øu≈øpition that

Nay, common fame is more then ordinarily fal≈øe, if none of them have found a way to reconcile the opinions of <hi>Rome</hi> to the preferments of <hi>England;</hi> &amp; be ≈øo ab≈øolutely directly and cordially Papi≈øts, that it is all that fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a yeare can doe to keep them from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øsing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I come now to ≈øpeake of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and con≈øidering the great intere≈øt the≈øe men have had in our common Ma≈øter, and con≈øidering how great a good to us, they might have made that intere≈øt in him, if they would have u≈øed it to have informed him of our generall ≈øufferings; and con≈øidering how little of their freedome of Speech at <hi>Whitehall</hi> might have ≈øaved us a great deale of the u≈øe wee have now of it in the Parliament-hou≈øe, their not doing this alone were occa≈øion enough for us to accu≈øe them as the betrayers, though not as the de≈øtroyers of our rights and liberties: Though, I confe≈ø≈øe, if they had been onely ≈øilent in this particular, I had beene ≈øilent too; But, alas, they who≈øe Ance≈øtors in the darke≈øt times excommunicated the breakers of <hi>Magna charta,</hi> did now by them≈øelves, and their adherents, both write, preach, plot, and act again≈øt it, by encouraging Doctor <hi>Beale,</hi> by preferring Doctor <hi>Mannering,</hi> appearing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for Monopolies and ≈øhip-mony: and if any were ≈ølow and backeward to comply, bla≈øting both them and their preferment, with utmo≈øt expre≈øsion of their hatred, the title of Puritans.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:156910:126"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> wee ≈øhall find ≈øome of them to have labour'd to exclude both all per≈øons, and all cau≈øes of the Clergy, from the ordinary juri≈ødiction of the temporall Magi≈øtrate, and by hindring prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions (fir≈øt by apparent power again≈øt the Judges, and after by ≈øecret agreements with them) to have taken away the onely legall bound to their arbitrary power, and made as it were a conque≈øt upon the common law of the Land, which is our common inheritance; and after made u≈øe of that power to turn their brethren out of their free-holds, for not doing that which no law of man required of them to doe; and which (in their opinions) the law of God required of them not to doe. Wee ≈øhall finde them in generall to have encouraged all the Clergy to ≈øuites, and to have brought all ≈øuites to the Councell-table, that having all power in Eccle≈øia≈øticall matters, they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for equall power in Temporall, and to di≈øpo≈øe as well of every Office, as of every Benefice; which lo≈øt the Clergy much revenew, and much reverence, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the la≈øt is never given when it is ≈øo asked,) by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them indi≈øcreetly to exact more of both then was due; ≈øo that indeed the gaine of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe extended but to a few of that order, though the envy extended upon all.</p>
               <p>We ≈øhall find of them to have both kindled &amp; blown the common fire of both nations, to have both ≈øent and maintained that booke, of which the Author no doubt hath long ≈øince wi≈øh'd with <hi>Nero, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>tinam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øci≈ø≈øem literas!</hi> and of which more then one Kingdome hath cau≈øe to wi≈øh, that when hee writ that, hee had rather burnd a Library, though of the value of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>'s. We ≈øhall finde them to have beene the fir≈øt and principall cau≈øe of the breach, I will not ≈øay of, but ≈øince the pacification at <hi>Berwike.</hi> We ≈øhall find them to have beene the almo≈øt ≈øole abettors of my Lord of

                  <hi>Strafford,</hi> while≈øt hee was practi≈øing upon another Kingdome that manner of government which hee intended to ≈øettle in this, where he committed ≈øo many, ≈øo mighty, and ≈øo manife≈øt enormities and oppre≈ø≈øions, as the like have not beene committed by any Governour in any government, ≈øince <hi>Verres</hi> left <hi>Sicily.</hi> And after they had called him over from being Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to bee in a manner Deputy of <hi>England,</hi> (all things here being govern'd by a <hi>Juntillo,</hi> and that <hi>Juntillo</hi> govern'd by him) to have a≈øi≈øted him in the giving of ≈øuch Councells, and the pur≈øuing of ≈øuch cour≈øes, as it is a hard and mea≈øuring ca≈øt, whether they were more unwi≈øe, more unju≈øt, or more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and which had infallibly beene our de≈øtruction, if by the grace of God, their ≈øhare had not beene as ≈ømall in the ≈øubtilty of Serpents, as in the innocency of Doves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I have repre≈øented no ≈ømall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and no meane degree of guilt; and truly I beleeve that wee ≈øhall make no little complement to tho≈øe, and no little apologie for tho≈øe to whom this charge belongs, if wee ≈øhall lay the faults of the men upon the order of the Bi≈øhops, upon the <hi>Epi≈øcopacy.</hi> I wi≈øh we may di≈øtingui≈øh betweene tho≈øe, who have beene carried away with the ≈øtreame, and tho≈øe who have beene the ≈øtreame that carry'd them; betweene tho≈øe who≈øe proper and naturall motion was towards our ruine and de≈øtruction, and tho≈øe who have beene whirl'd about to it, contrary to their naturall motion, by the force and ≈øwinge of ≈øuperiour <hi>Orbes:</hi> and as I wi≈øh wee may di≈øtingui≈øh betweene the more and le≈ø≈øe guilty; ≈øo I yet more wi≈øh wee may di≈øtingui≈øh betweene the guilty and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I doubt, if we con≈øider that if not the fir≈øt Planters, yet the fir≈øt Spreaders of Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

I doubt not, I ≈øay, but if wee con≈øider this, this con≈øideration will bring forth this conclu≈øion, That Bi≈øhops may be good men, and let us give but good men good rules, we ≈øhall have both good governours and good times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> I am content to take away all tho≈øe things from them which, to any con≈øiderable degree of probability, may againe beget the like mi≈øchiefes, if they be not taken away. If their temporall titles, power and employment, appeare likely to di≈øtract them from the care of, or make them looke downe with contempt upon their Spirituall duty, and that the too great di≈øtance betweene them and tho≈øe they governe will hinder the free and fit recour≈øe of their inferiours to them, and occa≈øion in≈øolence from them to their inferiours; let that be con≈øidered, and car'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:156910:127"/>for; I am ≈øure neither their Lord≈øhips, their judging of tythes, wills and marriages, no nor their voyces in Parliaments are <hi>Jure divino;</hi> and I am as ≈øure that the≈øe titles, and this power are not nece≈ø≈øary to their authority, as appeares by the little they have had with us by them, and the much that others have had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
               <p>If their revenew ≈øhall appeare likely to produce the ≈øame effects, (for it hath beene anciently ob≈øerv'd that <hi>Religio peperit divitias, &amp; Filia devoravit matrem;</hi>) let ≈øo much of that, as was in all probability intended for an attendant upon their temporall dignities, wait upon them out of the doors: Let us onely take care to leave them ≈øuch proportions, as may ≈øerve in ≈øome good degree to the dignity of learning, and the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ≈øtudents; and let us not invert that of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and as he made the meane≈øt of the people Prie≈øts, make the highe≈øt of the Prie≈øts the meane≈øt of the people.</p>
               <p>If it be feared that they will againe employ ≈øome of our Lawes with a ≈øeverity beyond the intention of tho≈øe Lawes again≈øt ≈øome of their weaker Brethren; that we may be ≈øure to take away that power, let us take away tho≈øe Lawes, and let no ceremonies which any number counts unlawfull, and no man counts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary (again≈øt the rules of <hi>Policy,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) be impo≈øed upon them. Let us con≈øider, that part of the rule they have hitherto gone by, that is, ≈øuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of their owne making as are not confirm'd by Parliament, have beene, or, no doubt, ≈øhortly will bee by Parliament taken away: that the other part of the rule (≈øuch Canons as were here received before the reformation, and not contrary to any law,) is too doubtfull to be a fit rule, exacting an exact knowledge of the Canon-law, of the Common-law, of the Statute-law knowledges, which tho≈øe who are thus to governe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:156910:128"/>have not, and it is ≈øcarce fit they ≈øhould have. Since therefore wee are to make new rules, and ≈øhall, no doubt, make tho≈øe new rules ≈øtrict rules, and bee infallibly certaine of a trienniall Parliament, to ≈øee tho≈øe rules ob≈øerv'd as ≈øtrictly as they are made, and to encrea≈øe or change them upon all occa≈øions; wee ≈øhall have no rea≈øon to feare any innovation from their tyranny, or to doubt any defect in the di≈øcharge of their duty: I am confident, they will not dare, either ordaine, ≈øu≈øpend, ≈øilence, excommunicate, or deprive otherwi≈øe, then we would have them. And if this be beleeved, I am as confident, we ≈øhall not think it fit to aboli≈øh, upon a few dayes debate, an Order which hath la≈øted (as appeares by ≈øtory) in mo≈øt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the≈øe ≈øixteene hundred yeares, and in all from Chri≈øt to <hi>Calvin;</hi> or in an in≈øtant change the whole face of the Church, like the ≈øcene of a Maske.</p>

It is goodne≈ø≈øe (My Lords) that can produce, not onely to his people, but likewi≈øe to him≈øelf honour and happine≈øs. There are Principalities, Thrones and Dominions among≈øt the Divels, greatne≈øs enough; but being uncapable
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:156910:130"/>of goodne≈øs, they are made uncapable both of honour and happine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>The Lawes of this Kingdome have inve≈øted the Royall Crowne with power ≈øufficient for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtation of his goodne≈øs and of his greatne≈øs: if more bee required, it is like to have no other effects but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, weakne≈ø≈øe, and mi≈øerie, whereof of late wee have had very wofull experience. It is farre from the Commons to de≈øire any abridgement of tho≈øe great Prerogatives which belong to the King; they know that their own Liberty &amp; Peace are pre≈øerved and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by his Prerogative, &amp; they will alwayes be ready to ≈øupport and ≈øupply his Maje≈øty with their lives and fortunes, for the maintenance of his ju≈øt and lawfull Power.</p>
               <p>This (My Mords) is in all our thoughts, in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and I hope will ≈øo be manife≈øted in our indeavours, that if the proceedings of this <hi>Parliament</hi> bee not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted as others have beene, the King may within a few moneths bee put into a cleare way, of as much greatne≈ø≈øe, plenty and glory, as any of his Royall Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors have enjoyed.</p>
               <p>A King and his People make one Body: the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts conferre nouri≈øhment and ≈øtrength, the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ≈øen≈øe and motion: If there be an interruption of this nece≈ø≈øary intercour≈øe of bloud and ≈øpirits, the whole Body mu≈øt needs bee ≈øubject to decay and di≈øtemper; therefore ob≈øtructions are fir≈øt to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, before re≈øtoratives can be applyed. This (My Lords) is the end of this Accu≈øation, whereby the Commons ≈øeeke to remove this per≈øon, whom they conceive to have beene a great cau≈øe of the ob≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betwixt his Maje≈øty and his People: for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof, they have commanded mee to de≈øire your Lord≈øhips, that their proceedings again≈øt him

               <p>BY hearing this Charge, your Lord≈øhips may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what neere conjunction there is betweene this Cau≈øe and the Earle of STRAFFORDS: the materials are (for the mo≈øt part) the ≈øame in both: the offences of the Earle moving from an higher Orb, are more comprehen≈øive, they extend both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the≈øe (except in one particular of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Army) are confined within one Kingdome; the Earle is charged as an Authour, Sir GEORGE RATCLIFFE as an In≈øtrument and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Actor.</p>
               <p>The influences of ≈øuperiour Planets are often aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and inforced, but ≈øeldome mitigated by the concurrence of the inferiour, where merit doth ari≈øe not from well-doing, but from ill; the officiou≈øne≈ø≈øe of mini≈øters will rather adde to the malignity of their In≈øtructions, then dimini≈øh it, that ≈øo they may more fully ingratiate them≈øelves with tho≈øe upon whom they depend.</p>
               <p>In the crimes committed by the Earle there appears more haughtine≈ø≈øe and fiercene≈ø≈øe, being acted by his owne principles; tho≈øe motions are ever ≈øtronge≈øt which are neere≈øt the <hi>Primum mobile:</hi> But in tho≈øe of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:156910:131"/>Sir GEORGE RATCLIFFE there ≈øeemes to be more ba≈øene≈ø≈øe and ≈øervility, having re≈øigned and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him≈øelfe to bee acted by the corrupt will of onother.</p>
               <p>The Earle of STRAFFORD hath not beene bred in the ≈øtudy and practice of the Law, and having ≈øtronger lu≈øts and pa≈øsions to incite, and le≈ø≈øe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to re≈øtraine him, might more ea≈øily be tran≈øpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Rule; Sir GEORGE RATCLIFFE in his naturall temper and di≈øpo≈øition more moderate, and by his education and profe≈øsion better acquainted with the grounds and directions of the Law, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into his offences by a more immediate Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of will, and a more corrupt ≈øuppre≈øsion of his owne Rea≈øon and Judgement.</p>
               <p>My Lords, as both the≈øe have beene partners in offending: ≈øo it is the de≈øire of the Commons, they may bee put under ≈øuch tryall and examination, and other proceedings of ju≈øtice as may bring them to partake in a de≈øerved puni≈øhment, for the ≈øafety and good of both Kingdomes.</p>

               <p>I Have heard, ≈øince I had the honour to ≈øit here, many grievances pre≈øented, and truly Sir, my heart bleeds within mee when I thinke of them, e≈øpecially tho≈øe that concerne Religion. But what ≈øhould I ≈øpeake of grievances concerning Religion, when Religion it ≈øelfe is become a grievance, nay the very Nur≈øe and Mother of all grievances, all ≈øcandalls, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches?</p>
               <q>Tantum Religio potuit ≈øuadere malorum.</q>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>Not to trouble you with any long di≈øcour≈øe, if I have any ≈øight, that Bark both of Church and State hath a long time floated betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> Popery on the one ≈øide, and I know not what to call it on the other; in many re≈øpects both alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unle≈ø≈øe the Italian Proverb may alter the Ca≈øe; <hi>God defend me from my reputed friends, and I will defend my ≈øelfe from my profe≈øt enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Wee are intru≈øted by God, the King and the Countrey, with the managing of this Bark, fraught
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:156910:133"/>with the fortunes of three great Kingdomes: Now, ≈øhould wee ≈øo decline the former Rock, that wee da≈øh on the other ≈øide. I humbly offer it to this Honourable A≈ø≈øembly, whether ≈øhee might not have ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øay, ≈øhee had changed her Pilot rather then her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and onely ≈øhifted places to finde her ruine: For Sir, there is as much beyond Truth, as on this ≈øide it; and would wee ≈øteere a right cour≈øe, wee mu≈øt be ≈øure to keepe the channell, le≈øt wee fall from one extreme to another; from the dotage of Super≈øtition, to the frenzie of Profanene≈ø≈øe; from bowing to Idols, to wor≈øhip the Calves of our owne imaginations.</p>
               <p>Sir, I be≈øeech you con≈øider what libellous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets are now printed, what Sermons are preached, not building hay and ≈øtubble, but utterly ≈øubverting the foundations of Truth; what irreverence in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, what profanation of Gods Service, to the ≈øcandall of Chri≈øtianity, the reproach of Religion, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable griefe of all good men; of which I may take up the words of <hi>Petrus de Aliaco</hi> to the Councell of <hi>Con≈øtance, Ni≈øi celeriter fiat Reformatio, audeo dicere qu√≤d lic√®t magna ≈øint quae videmus, tamen in brevi incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia majora videmus, &amp; post i≈øta tam horrenda majora alia audiemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I take God to record, I am no mans Advocate, no mans enemy; but a faithfull lover of truth and peace, and a dutifull Son of our di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Mother, the Church of England; in who≈øe behalfe, and our owne, my moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øhall bee ≈øhortly this, That the Mini≈øters Petition, with ≈øo much of their Remon≈øtrance as hath been read, may be committed, and the re≈øt of it, concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine, may bee referred to ≈øome learned and approved Divines, who have ≈øpent their time in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øtudy. For, give me leave to tell you, there is a <hi>vulgus</hi> among the Clergy, as among the Laity, <hi>Et in utroque nil modicum;</hi> and for the≈øe and all things which ≈øtrike
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:156910:134"/>at the roote and branch, as they plea≈øe to call it, I ≈øhall humbly move, that wee rather con≈øider how to ≈øatisfie the Petitioners with ≈øome timely declaration from both Hou≈øes of the lawfulne≈ø≈øe and conveniency of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øcopall Government, derived from the Apo≈øtles, and ≈øo long e≈øtabli≈øhed in this Kingdome, rather then to venture upon any alteration, the con≈øequence whereof the wi≈øe≈øt man cannot fore-≈øee. And in truth, Sir, ≈øhould we once begin (for my owne part) I know not how, or where wee ≈øhould ≈øtay. Neverthele≈ø≈øe, if any one doubt the ≈øuperiority of Bi≈øhops over Prie≈øts and Deacons in Eccle≈øia≈øticall government, or in ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ≈øhall be ready, when≈øoever this Hou≈øe ≈øhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mee, to make it good, and I think, by as pregnant te≈øtimonies as wee are able to prove the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Canonicall and Apocryphall Scripture, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsity of Infants bapti≈øme, or that the Apo≈øtles were the Authors of their owne Creed. But, Sir, I hope you will ≈øave your ≈øelfe and mee that labour, and rather devi≈øe of ≈øome ≈øet way to bind up the Churches wounds, which (God knowes) are too wide already, that ≈øo the Clergy and Laity being made friends, and all reduced to the modell of our Ance≈øtors ≈øince the Reformation, we may altogether pre≈øerve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and ≈øo his Maje≈øty having grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly and prudently expre≈øt him≈øelfe, I am the more confident wee ≈øhall not onely put an end to all mi≈ø-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence betwixt Prince and People, but al≈øo highly advance the Prote≈øtant cau≈øe, and give a deadly blow to the See of Rome.</p>

               <p>I Am to make a Report of what was delivered at the conference of a Committee of both Hou≈øes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon Thur≈øday la≈øt.</p>
               <p>I hope, <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> ≈øo much upon the favour of this Hou≈øe that they will give mee leave to be a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that they will not expect from my age and weakne≈ø≈øe a particular repetition of the ≈øame words, a taske too great for my memory unpracti≈øed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares in ≈øuch exactne≈ø≈øe; neither am I able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent without diminution, that life, and grace, that tho≈øe relations received from ≈øo great abilities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring their Lord≈øhips pardon, and your acceptance of the ≈øub≈øtance and matter, wherein I hope I ≈øhall omit nothing ≈øub≈øtantiall; and if I could repeate every word, yet would it want as much lu≈øter as copies of ordinary hands, doe of the be≈øt originals.</p>
               <p>My Lord Keeper did fir≈øt let us know, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty had commanded the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners of the great Councell, to give an account of their Treaties at Yorke and Rippon, to both Hou≈øes; and of his Maje≈øties gracious intentions, in a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øo much importing the honour and ≈øafety of the Kingdome, that there might be made a faithfull relation with all
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:156910:135"/>candor and clearne≈ø≈øe, which was the ≈øumme of his Maje≈øties in≈øtructions.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip declaring that my Lords of the upper Hou≈øe, for the ≈øaving of time, had thought fit to give this account to a Committee of both Hou≈øes, which hath occa≈øioned the meeting at this Conference; and election being made of the Earle of Bri≈øtoll by the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners, he began his Narration, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Lords of the upper Hou≈øe, and to the Knights, Citizens and Burge≈ø≈øes of the hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and thus the Earle of Bri≈øtoll began;</p>
               <p>That the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners intended not to looke further back into the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, then the Acts of their own imployments.</p>
               <p>They did intend to give no account of the pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation interrupted, nor war renewed; no account how the Armies in England, Ireland, and by Sea were de≈øigned, nor of any occa≈øion: They purpo≈øed not to lay fault upon any man, nor to enquire into the cau≈øe why the Scots (as they pretended from nece≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) were drawne to enter this Kingdome, nor why the Kings Army, when ≈øervice was to be done, was out of the way; But that tho≈øe through who≈øe hands the≈øe have pa≈ø≈øed, might hereafter give their own account.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip told us, that his Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to call his great Councell at Yorke, to whom he made two propo≈øitions.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt was, how his Army, which ≈øeemed to be in di≈øtre≈ø≈øe for want of pay, ≈øhould be relieved and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>To this, to ≈øhew their duties to the King, the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to ingage them≈øelves, and to that purpo≈øe to ≈øend cho≈øen Deputies to London, to negotiate a ≈øupply.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond propo≈øition was, that after the Scots had pa≈ø≈øed Northumberland, taken Newca≈øtle, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the Bi≈øhopricke of Dure≈øme, they ≈øent a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:156910:135"/>to his Maje≈øty, which containeth, in generall termes, a de≈øire to have their grievances taken into con≈øideration.</p>
               <p>Which Petition and An≈øwer thereunto was read unto us,<note place="margin">A. N. A.</note> and pre≈øented for our clearer under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Upon receipt of his Maje≈øties An≈øwer, the Scoti≈øh Lords ≈øent his Maje≈øty a ≈øecond Petition, directed in a Letter to the Earle of Lanrick,<note place="margin">K.

               <p>The bu≈øine≈ø≈øe thus ≈øtated at the great Councell, the ≈øecond propo≈øition was, what An≈øwer ≈øhould be made to that Petionary Letter, and in what manner it ≈øhould be carried; In which his Maje≈øty required their Councell.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lords replyed, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øsible for them to give any well grounded advice, unle≈ø≈øe the true ≈øtate of his affaires, and the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Army were laid before them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon his Maje≈øty commanded the Earle of Traquaire,<note place="margin">N. L.</note> to make the Narration of the Scoti≈øh bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, and their late Acts of Parliament, and the Lord Lievtenant generall, to give an account in what condition the Army ≈øtood, and what was an≈øwered by my Lord Lievtenant, was read in his owne words.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides this declaration, the Earle of Bri≈øtoll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon a further enquiry, how the ≈øtate of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe then ≈øtood:</p>
               <p>That the Scots Army had pa≈ø≈øed Northumberland without re≈øi≈øtance; that they had di≈øputed the pa≈ø≈øage
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:156910:136"/>of the River of Tyne at Newburne, where our hor≈øe retyred in di≈øorder; that his Maje≈øties foot Army con≈øi≈øting of twelve or fourteene thou≈øand men in Newca≈øtle, likewi≈øe retired to Yorke, whereby the Towne of Newca≈øtle, a place of great con≈øideration, was without one ≈øtroke ≈øtrucken, fallen into the Scots hands, and the Bi≈øhopricke of Dure≈øme drawn under Contribution.</p>
               <p>That in this ≈øtate, the Gentry of the Bi≈øhopricke repayred to Ma≈øter Trea≈øurer, who carryed them to his Maje≈øty, from whom they were referred to my Lord Lievtenant of the Army, who gave them this an≈øwer po≈øitively; That they could looke for no help nor protection from the King, and therefore they might u≈øe the be≈øt meanes they could to pre≈øerve their lives and e≈øtates. Whereby tho≈øe di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ancient Bulwarks of this Kingdome, full of brave and valiant men, being now fallen into the power of an Army, which of nece≈øsity mu≈øt live, were forced to con≈øent to a contribution by Treaty, and a very heavy one, though ≈øuch without which the Scoti≈øh Army could not ≈øub≈øi≈øt.</p>
               <p>The agreement was 350. <abbr>

                  </abbr> a day for Northumberland, 200. a day for the Towne of Newca≈øtle, in all 850. <abbr>

               <p>The≈øe Gentlemen much lamented their e≈øtates that the Scots ≈øhould be irritated (as they call it) by being proclaimed Traytors.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip made a little digre≈øsion, and asked leave to ≈øpeake truth in ≈øuch language, as the Scots had pre≈øented their ≈øtate unto them: That having procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made again≈øt them, being threatned with a great Army of thirty or forty thou≈øand men; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ten thou≈øand out of Ireland, and by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:156910:136"/>declared Traytors and Rebels, and having heard of another Army providing, of eight or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand by ≈øhipping to hinder their Trade, at lea≈øt their Commerce with England, that they were drawne together by nece≈øsity, as they pretended, of defence; further alledging that it was a common di≈øcour≈øe, of which they had ≈øeene papers, that they ≈øhould bee reduced into a Province, which would be but one Summers worke; and therefore they having drawne their power together, as any Nation would doe, and being a≈ø≈øembled, and their Country being poore, taking advantage of the time, and that all tho≈øe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that ≈øhould oppo≈øe them were out of the way, and tho≈øe unfortunate Provinces left like a li≈øt of Cloath; they were forced to enter in England; that thus they had lamented, and thus the ≈øtate ≈øtood before the Lords, when it was examined in the great Councell.</p>
               <p>Thus their Lord≈øhips found, that the Scots had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed their confines neere foure≈øcore miles in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and had pa≈ø≈øed the Rivers of Tweed and Tyne; and that the River of Tees the boundary of Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire, (Dure≈øme being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed) was not to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being foordable in many places by forty hor≈øe a front; that if the Scots ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe that River, there was no po≈øsibility to hinder them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Yorke, or to any part of England, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding a Battell, which my Lord Lievtenant had declared unto them he would not advi≈øe, for though the Kings Army con≈øi≈øted of ≈øeventeene or eighteene thou≈øand good bodies of men; yet being untrained and unu≈øed to Armes, he would be loath to hazzard ≈øuch an Adventure upon them; but if they ≈øhould advance to Yorke, hee might make good that Citie: This being the ca≈øe as it was pre≈øented, my Lords ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed his Maje≈øty that they conceived the fitte≈øt way
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:156910:137"/>was, that the Scots and their grievances might bee heard.</p>
               <p>And whereas their maine Complaint had beene, that their Petitions to his Maje≈øty had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Conduits of an evill relli≈øh, that there might be cho≈øen ≈øuch Lords Commi≈øsioners, of who≈øe integrity they could not doubt.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, his Maje≈øty was plea≈øed to referre the choyce of the Commi≈øsioners to the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, who made the election with the a≈ø≈øent of his Maje≈øty,<note place="margin">The Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners names <hi>N. B.</hi>
                  </note> to whom power was given, under the great ≈øeale of England, to heare what≈øoever the Scots would lay before them; and to enter into Treatie with them, and to give ≈øafe conducts, and to do all things preparatory to a Treaty.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt place of meeting was appointed at North-Allerton, but ≈øome inconveniences being found, it was by con≈øent transferred to Rippon.</p>
               <p>For the inducement of this meeting,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> a Letter of the Lord Lanricks to the Scots Commi≈øsioners was read and given unto us.</p>
               <p>The Treaty thus ≈øettled, the Lords to be imployed receiving in≈øtructions from his Maje≈øty, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the great Councell; it was agreed they ≈øhould treat upon the whole bu≈øine≈ø≈øe propounded by the Scots, and left to their di≈øcretion to treate of a Ce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation of Arms, as the ordinary fore-runner of all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace.</p>
               <p>When their Lord≈øhips came to Rippon, the Ce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation of Armes was the fir≈øt propo≈øed, but being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon it, the Scots Commi≈øsioners did let their Lord≈øhips know, that there was ≈øomething nece≈ø≈øary fir≈øt to be done, that the Countreys where they lay were become poore; that they could not thinke, as their affaires ≈øtood, of returning home; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty had re≈øtrayned them from pa≈øsing further: ≈øo
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:156910:137"/>that a Treaty in this Exigent was wor≈øe then a Warre, unle≈ø≈øe meanes might be thought upon how they might ≈øub≈øi≈øt; and hereupon they did propound, that if it were expected that they made no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øe therein, obeying his Maje≈øties command, which nothing but invincible nece≈øsity ≈øhould force them to tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe, by plundring the Countreys, they mu≈øt have maintenance for their Army.</p>
               <p>This motion ≈øeemed very ≈øtrange to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips, that it ≈øhould be demanded to provide a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the Scots, when the Kings owne Army was in great di≈øtre≈ø≈øe; yet the nece≈øsity ≈øeemed to be ≈øuch on both ≈øides, that the Lords appointed ≈øome of their Company to repaire to the King at Yorke, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Maje≈øty with the Scots demand.</p>
               <p>Upon debate of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, though it were of hard dige≈øtion to his Maje≈øty, the Lords, and the whole Kingdome, that they, who≈øe Ance≈øtors had been called to advi≈øe upon the Ran≈øome of Kings, ≈øhould now come to con≈øult how to maintaine an Army got into our owne bowels; Therefore, their Lord≈øhips would not proceed without the knowledge of his Maje≈øty and the great Councell; where it was found nece≈ø≈øary, not for maintaining the Scots Armies (for they might ea≈øily ≈øupply their owne wants by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, in which cour≈øe they might get a million, whereas five thou≈øand pounds would ≈øerve but for two months) but to pre≈øerve the Countreys from utter ruine, and the Scots from further advancing, to give to their Lord≈øhips Commi≈øsion to treate for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of maintenance during the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt demand was forty thou≈øand pounds a moneth, which by Treaty was reduced thus: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of giving them any allowance, they ≈øhould bee left to their proportion of that contribution already agreed upon by the Counties, as le≈ø≈øe di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:156910:138"/>then to a≈øsigne them maintenance.</p>
               <p>This point being thus ≈øettled,<note place="margin">N. D. E.</note> their Lord≈øhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Treaty of Se≈øsions, and both were agreed and concluded, his Lord≈øhip propo≈øing the Articles them≈øelves to bee read for more ≈øatisfaction.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip proceeded, that the≈øe preparatives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øettled at Rippon, twenty miles from Yorke, and the time far ≈øpent, and the Parliament approaching, their Lord≈øhips re≈øolved to bee humble ≈øuitors to his Maje≈øty, that the generall Treaty might be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to London, by con≈øent of both parties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto agreeing.</p>
               <p>Here his Lord≈øhip propo≈øed the reading of a Letter whereby this tran≈ølation of the Treaty was moved, which was done and delivered unto us.</p>
               <p>To this Letter his Maje≈øty made a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, and con≈øented to transferre the Treaty to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where ≈øome of the Scots Commi≈øsioners are already arrived, and the re≈øt within a day or two expected.</p>
               <p>Their Lord≈øhips having proceeded in the Treaty as far as they could goe, repaired to Yorke, and both Articles concluded were read in his Maje≈øties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence; and that they declared that they had in all things punctually ob≈øerved their In≈øtructions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Maje≈øty required them to give their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell, whether he ≈øhould ratifie and ≈øigne the≈øe Articles or not.</p>
               <p>To which the Lords made an≈øwer, that they had ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Maje≈øty in quality of Commi≈øsioners Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and had duly ob≈øerved their In≈øtructions; but now He being plea≈øed to aske their advice, they would bee glad to ≈øerve him according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences, and therefore be≈øought his Maje≈øty for leave to retire them≈øelves, and con≈øult of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:156910:138"/>which his Maje≈øty was graciou≈øly plea≈øed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent.</p>
               <p>Upon re≈øolution, con≈øidering the great ≈øtrait into which his Maje≈øties affaires were reduced, they concluded to advi≈øe his Maje≈øty to ≈øigne, and craved leave to pre≈øent unto his Maje≈øty a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their rea≈øons; which were accepted and read in the great Councell.</p>
               <p>And their Lord≈øhips held it nece≈ø≈øary to bee read againe in that great A≈ø≈øembly,<note place="margin">N. G.</note> as the re≈øt of their Councell.</p>
               <p>The≈øe rea≈øons being read, his Maje≈øty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to ratifie the Articles in expre≈ø≈øe words al≈øo read unto us.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip concluded this Narrative as the full account of the Treaty,<note place="margin">N. D.</note> and proceeding in it to his Maje≈øties ratification; and craved leave in the next place, to pre≈øent the hard and wofull condition in which his Maje≈øties affaires then ≈øtood in the North:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, that by con≈øent a contribution of 850. <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a day was agreed.</p>
               <p>That there was already ≈øome doubt that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were not able to beare it.</p>
               <p>On the other ≈øide, it was objected by the Scots, that it was impo≈øsible if the payment ≈øhould faile, to keepe their promi≈øe, or to obey his Maje≈øty, but that they ≈øhould be nece≈øsitated again≈øt their will to plunder the Country.</p>
               <p>The≈øe doubts con≈øidered, it was declared by my Lord Lievtenant, that the Counties of Cumberland and We≈øtmerland being at plea≈øure under the Scots power, it was rea≈øonable that <hi>in ≈øub≈øidium</hi> they ≈øhould contribute ≈øome helpe to their Neighbours: But hee declared ≈øince their Lord≈øhips coming away, the Commi≈øsioners left at Dure≈øme had written, that it
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:156910:139"/>was impo≈øsible for them to proceed in the agreement; which if it were broken on their part, the Scots would alledge an impo≈øsibility to con≈øent to ≈øtarve; ≈øo that if ≈øome meanes were not found, by which tho≈øe Counties engaged might bee relieved, hee was affraid all their labour and Treaty would come to nothing: and this letter was read and pre≈øented unto us.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip repre≈øented,<note place="margin">N. H.</note> that the Commi≈øsioners and all the Lords had engaged them≈øelves faithfully and truly to declare to the Parliament the di≈øtre≈ø≈øe of the Counties.</p>
               <p>Hee declared that it was far from their Lord≈øhips purpo≈øe to move any ≈øupply of money from the Hou≈øe of Commons, but to lay the cau≈øe before them, and to leave it to their wi≈øedome; averring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that if ≈øome cour≈øe were not taken, the whole kingdome would be put into di≈øorder; Armies would not ≈øtarve, retiring was not yet as hee thought in the thoughts of the Scots: Therefore they mu≈øt plunder and de≈øtroy, or advance into Yorke≈øhire, and ≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England to ≈øeeke ≈øub≈øi≈øtence; the prevention whereof did highly import the King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip propo≈øed another, no le≈ø≈øe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of con≈øideration to the whole kingdome: But if the Scots Army were provided of a competency for the ea≈øe of tho≈øe Counties, it were very ≈øtrange there ≈øhould not an equall care be had for mainteining the Kings Army that ≈øtands before them. He ≈øaid the Scots Army was ≈øtrong and powerfull, and little other re≈øi≈øtance again≈øt it, but the impediments of an Army marching in winter: But whether it were fit for a kingdome to bee tru≈øted to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Fro≈øts, with a people bred in Swedland
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:156910:139"/>and cold Countreys, hee left to their di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip confe≈ø≈øed, that the Scots had made great prote≈øtations, and with great execrations averred, that they had no intent to advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but returne when they ≈øhall have received ≈øatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Yet their Lord≈øhips did not conceive that the kingdome ≈øhould relye upon promi≈øes or prote≈øtations.</p>
               <p>Many accidents might happen when a Nation, come from a farre Countrey to a better, ≈øhould bee told the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe they come about was ju≈øt and their quarrell good; who finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in a fat pa≈øture, may pick quarrells which their Leaders, if they ≈øhould goe about to prevent them of the reward of their vertue and valour.</p>
               <p>Upon the≈øe grounds his Lord≈øhip pre≈øented to the generall con≈øideration the ≈øupply of his Maje≈øties Army, that it bee not disbanded; which if it ≈øhould come to pa≈ø≈øe. Yorke≈øhire and other parts of England were left to the Scots di≈øcretion.</p>
               <p>His Lord≈øhip ≈øaid, Hee dur≈øt not ≈øay the Scots would not come forward, but that it was in their power if they would; and therefore hee recommended this repre≈øentation to the whole body of the kingdome, to prevent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dangers.</p>
               <p>Hee concluded with a prayer to Almighty God, to direct the hearts of all the kingdome, and to give a ble≈øsing onely able to remove the great di≈øtractions, ≈øo many and ≈øo grievous, as under which, ≈øince the Conque≈øt, this kingdome never laboured.</p>

               <p>I Will u≈øe no preface, as they u≈øe to doe who appeare men for ≈øome thing to which they would per≈øwade and move their affections: I will onely propo≈øe what I conceive fit for the Hou≈øe to con≈øider, and ≈øhall be no more concerned in the event then they that ≈øhall heare mee.</p>
               <p>Two things I ob≈øerve in his Maje≈øties demands:</p>
               <list>

                  <item>Secondly, our ≈øpeedy di≈øpatch thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Touching the fir≈øt, his Maje≈øties occa≈øions for mony are but too evident; for to ≈øay nothing how wee are neglected abroad, or di≈øtracted at home, the calling of this Parliament and our ≈øitting here (an effect which no light cau≈øe could in the≈øe times have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) is enough to make any rea≈øonable man beleeve that the Exchequer abounds not ≈øo much in money, as the State in occa≈øions to u≈øe it; and I hope we ≈øhall all appeare willing to di≈øprove tho≈øe who have thought to di≈ø≈øwade his Maje≈øty from this way of Parliament, as doubting and uncertaine, and to let him ≈øee that it is as ready and more ≈øafe for the advancement of his affaires, then any new or pretended old way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:156910:142"/>
               <p>Now <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> for the ≈øpeedy di≈øpatch requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was the ≈øecond thing, not onely his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie but <hi>Res ip≈øa loquitur;</hi> the occa≈øion ≈øeemes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune no le≈ø≈øe: nece≈øsity is come upon us like an armed man, and yet the u≈øe of Parliaments hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (which appeare by the writs that call us hither) was to advi≈øe with his Maje≈øty of things concerning the Church and common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Ma≈øter Speaker,</hi> it hath ever been the cu≈øtome of Parliaments, by good and whole≈øome lawes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øh the Common-wealth in generall, yea and to de≈øcend into the remedies of particular grievances, before any mention made of ≈øupply. Looke backe upon the be≈øt Parliaments, and ≈øtill you ≈øhall finde that the la≈øt Acts are the free gift of the Sub≈øidies on the peoples part, and generall pardons on the Kings part; even the wi≈øe≈øt Kings have acquainted their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their de≈øignes, and the rea≈øons thereof, and then demanded the a≈øsi≈øtance both of their coun≈øell and their pur≈øes: But <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> Phy≈øicians (though they be called of the late≈øt) mu≈øt not ≈øtomach it, or talke what might have beene, but apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves roundly to the cure; let us not ≈øtand too nicely upon circum≈øtances, nor too rigidly po≈øt po≈øe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øupply, to the healing of our lighter wounds. Let us doe what po≈øsibly may be done with rea≈øon and hone≈øty on our parts to comply with his Maje≈øties de≈øires, and to prevent the imminent ills which threaten us: but con≈øider <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> that they that thinke them≈øelves undone can never apprehend them≈øelves in danger, and they that have nothing left can never give freely, nor ≈øhall we ever di≈øcharge the tru≈øt of tho≈øe that ≈øent us hither, or make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they contribute to their owne defence and ≈øafety, unle≈ø≈øe his Maje≈øty be plea≈øed, fir≈øt to re≈øtore them to the propriety of their goods and lawfull liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:156910:143"/>whereof they e≈øteeme them≈øelves now out of po≈ø≈øe≈øsion. One need not tell you that the propriety of goods is the mother of courage, and nur≈øe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry, makes us all valiant in war, and good husbands in peace: the experience I heare of former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and my pre≈øent ob≈øervation of the care the Countrey hath had to choo≈øe per≈øons of worth and courage, makes mee thinke this Hou≈øe like the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, who≈øe forward valour required ≈øome ≈øofter mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicke to allay and quiet their ≈øpirits, too much moved with the ≈øound of martiall In≈øtruments. 'Tis not the feare of impri≈øonment, or, if need be, of death it ≈øelfe that can keepe a true hearted Engli≈øh-man from the care to leave this part of his inheritance as intire to po≈øterity as hee received it from his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors.</p>
               <p>This therefore let us fir≈øt doe, (and the more ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,) that we may come to the matter of ≈øupply; let us give new force to the many lawes which have beene heretofore made for the mainteining of our rights and priviledges, and to re≈øtore this Nation to the fundamentall and vitall liberties, the propriety of our goods, and freedome of our per≈øons; no way doubting but we ≈øhall find his Maje≈øty as gracious and ready, as any of his Royall progenitors have beene, to grant our ju≈øt de≈øires therein: for, not onely the people doe thinke, but the wi≈øe≈øt doe know, that what wee have ≈øuffered, wee have ≈øuffered from his Mini≈øters. That the per≈øon of no King was ever better beloved of his people, and that no people were ever more un≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the wayes of levying moneys, are two truths which may ≈øerve one to demon≈øtrate the other; for ≈øuch is their acce≈øsion to the pre≈øent cour≈øes, that neither the admiration they have of his Maje≈øties native inclination to Ju≈øtice and Clemency, nor the pretended con≈øent of the Judges, could make them
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:156910:143"/>willingly ≈øubmit them≈øelves to this late tax; and ≈øuch is their naturall loves, and ju≈øt e≈øteeme of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties goodne≈ø≈øe, that no late pre≈ø≈øure could provoke them, not any example invite them to di≈øloyalty or di≈øobedience. But what is it then hath bred this mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under≈øtanding betwixt the King and his people? How is it that having ≈øo good a King, wee have ≈øo much to complaine of? Why <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> wee are told of the ≈øonne of <hi>Solomon</hi> that hee was a Prince of a tender heart, and yet we ≈øee, by the advice of violent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, how rough an an≈øwer he gave to his people. That his finger ≈øhould bee as heavy as his fathers loynes, was not his owne, but the voyce of ≈øome per≈øons about him, that wanted the gravity of moderation requi≈øite for the Coun≈øellors of a young King. I love not to pre≈ø≈øe Allegories too far; but the re≈øemblance of <hi>Jobs</hi> ≈øtory with ours holds ≈øo well that I cannot but ob≈øerve it to you. It plea≈øed God to give his Enemy leave to afflict him more then once or twice, and to take all hee had from him, and yet he was not provoked to rebell ≈øo much as with his tongue, (although hee had no very good example of one that lay very neere him,) and felt not halfe that which he ≈øuffered. I hope his Maje≈øty will imitate God in the benigner part too, and as he was ≈øevere to <hi>Job</hi> onely while hee di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed with another concerning him, but when hee vouch≈øafed to ≈øpeake him≈øelfe unto him, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke tho≈øe who had mi≈øtaken and mi≈ø-judged his Ca≈øe, and to re≈øtore the patient man to his former pro≈øperity: ≈øo now, that his Maje≈øty hath admitted us to his pre≈øence, and ≈øpoken face to face with us, I doubt not but wee ≈øhall ≈øee fairer dayes, and be as rich in the po≈ø≈øe≈øsion of our owne as ever wee were. I wonder at tho≈øe that ≈øeeme to doubt the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of this Parliament, or that the mi≈øunder≈øtanding betwixt the King and his People ≈øhould la≈øt any longer, now
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:156910:144"/>they have ≈øo happily met. His Maje≈øties wants are not ≈øo great, but that we may find meanes to ≈øupply him; nor our de≈øires ≈øo unrea≈øonable, or ≈øo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible with government, but that his Maje≈øty may well ≈øatisfie them. For our late experience (I hope) will teach us what rocks to ≈øhunne and how nece≈øtary the u≈øe of moderation is: And for his Maje≈øty, he hath had experience enough how that pro≈øpers which is gotten without the concurrent good will of his people: never more money taken from the Subject, never more want in the Exchequer. If we looke upon what we have payd, it is more then ever the people of England did in ≈øuch a time; if we looke upon what hath beene effected therewith, it ≈øhewes as if never King had beene wor≈øe ≈øupplyed; ≈øo that we ≈øeeme to have acted <hi>Belids</hi> part, who≈øe puni≈øhment was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour the filling of a Sive with water. Who≈øoever gave advice for the≈øe cour≈øes, hath made good the ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wi≈øe man, <hi>Qui conturbat domum ≈øuam po≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit ventum.</hi> By new wayes they think to accompli≈øh wonders, but in truth they gra≈øpe the winde, and are in the meane time <hi>≈øaevus ambobus Achilles,</hi> cruell to us, and to the King too: for if the Common-wealth flouri≈øh, then hee that hath the Soveraignty can never want nor doe ami≈ø≈øe, ≈øo as hee governe not according to the intere≈øt of others, but goe the ≈øhorte≈øt and the ≈øafe≈øt wayes to his owne and the common good, with regard how they ≈øtand in order to any private mans de≈øires, or a pre≈øervation. The Kings of this Nation have alwayes governed by Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments: And if wee looke upon the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of things ≈øince Parliaments were layd by, it re≈øembles that of the Grecians, <hi>Ex illo fluere &amp; vetito ≈øublap≈øa referri Rex Danaum,</hi> e≈øpecially on the Subjects parts; for though the King hath gotten little, they have lo≈øt all: but his Maje≈øty ≈øhall heare the truth from us, and wee ≈øhall
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:156910:144"/>make to appeare the errors of Divines, who would per≈øwade us that a Monarch can be ab≈øolute, and that he may doe all things, <hi>ad libitum,</hi> receding not onely from their text, (though that be a wandring too) but from the way which their owne profe≈øsion would teach them, <hi>Stare ≈øuper vias antiquas,</hi> and remove not the ancient bounds and land-markes which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ≈øet. If to be ab≈øolute were to be re≈øtrained by no lawes, then can no King in Chri≈øtendome be ≈øo, for they all ≈øtand obliged to the Lawes Chri≈øtian, and we aske no more: For to this Pillar are our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges fixt, our Kings at their Coronation taking a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oath not to infringe them. I am ≈øorry the≈øe men take not more care of informing our faith of tho≈øe things which they tell us for our ≈øoules health, whiles we know them ≈øo manife≈øtly in the wrong, in that which concerns the liberties &amp; priviledges of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of England: But they gaine preferment, and then 'tis no matter, though they never beleeve them≈øelves nor are beleeved of others. But ≈øince they are ≈øo ready to let loo≈øe the Con≈øcience of our Kings, we are the more carefully to provide for our protection again≈øt this Pulpit-Law, by declaring and re inforcing the Municipall Lawes of this kingdome. It is worth the ob≈øerving how new this opinion is, or rather this way of ri≈øing, even among≈øt them≈øelves. For, Ma≈øter <hi>Hooker,</hi> who ≈øure was no refractory man (as they terme it) thinkes that the fir≈øt Government was arbitrary, untill it was found, that to live by one mans will became the cau≈øe of all mens mi≈øeries, (the≈øe are his words;) and that this was the originall of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Lawes. And <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker.)</hi> if we looke furtner back, our Hi≈øtories will tell us that the Prelates of this kingdome have often beene the mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and his Subjects, to pre≈øent and pray redre≈ø≈øe of their grievances, and had reciprocally
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:156910:145"/>then as much love and reverence from the People: but the≈øe Preachers, more active then their Predece≈ø≈øors, and wi≈øer then the Lawes, have found out a better forme of Government; the King mu≈øt bee more ab≈øolute Monarch then any of his Predece≈ø≈øors, and to them hee mu≈øt owe it, though in the meane time they hazzard the hearts of his people, and involve him into a thou≈øand difficulties. For, ≈øuppo≈øe this forme of Government were inconvenient, and yet <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> this is but a ≈øuppo≈øition, for the≈øe five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares it hath not onely mainteined us in ≈øafety, but made us victorious over other Nations; but (I ≈øay) ≈øuppo≈øe they have another Idea of one more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, wee all know how dangerous Innovations are, and what hazzard tho≈øe Princes runne, that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe the change of a long e≈øtabli≈øhed Government. Now <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> of all our Kings that have gone before, and of all that are to ≈øucceed in this happy race, why ≈øhould ≈øo pious and ≈øo good a King bee expo≈øed to this trouble and hazzard? be≈øides that, Kings ≈øo diverted can never doe any great matter abroad. But <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> whiles the≈øe men have thus bent their wits again≈øt the Lawes of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whether they have neglected their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and what Tares are growne up in the field which they ≈øhould have tilled, I leave it to a ≈øecond con≈øideration; not but that Religion ought to bee the fir≈øt thing in our purpo≈øes and de≈øires, but that which is fir≈øt in dignity is not alwayes to precede in order of time; for, well-being ≈øuppo≈øes a being, and the fir≈øt impediment which men naturally indevour to remove, is the want of tho≈øe things without which they cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt. God fir≈øt a≈ø≈øigned unto <hi>Adam</hi> maintenance of life, and gave him a title to the re≈øt of the Creatures before he appointed a Law to ob≈øerve. And let me tell you (if our adver≈øaries have any ≈øuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:156910:145"/>de≈øigne) as there is nothing more ea≈øie then to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe Religion on a People deprived of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ≈øo there is nothing more hard then to doe the ≈øame upon Freemen. And therefore <hi>(Ma≈øter Speaker)</hi> I conclude with this motion, that an order may bee pre≈øently made, that the fir≈øt thing this Hou≈øe will con≈øider of, ≈øhall be the re≈øtoring this Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the fundamentall and vitall Liberties, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of our goods, and freedome of our Per≈øons: and that then wee will forthwith con≈øider of the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply de≈øired; and thus wee ≈øhall di≈øcharge the tru≈øt repo≈øed in us by tho≈øe that ≈øent us hither, his Maje≈øty will ≈øee that wee make more then ordinary ha≈øte to ≈øatisfie his demands, and wee ≈øhall let all tho≈øe know that ≈øeeke to ha≈øten the matter of ≈øupply, that they will ≈øo far delay it, as they give interruption to the former.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:156910:148"/>Maje≈øties Dominions e≈øtabli≈øhed: And finding al≈øo that there have beene, and having ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect that there ≈øtill are, even during this ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Parliament, indeavours to ≈øubvert the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes of England and Ireland, and to introduce the exerci≈øe of an Arbitrary and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Government, by mo≈øt pernicious and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Coun≈øels, Practices, Plots, and Con≈øpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And that the long intermi≈ø≈øion, and unhappy breach of Parliaments hath occa≈øioned many ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Taxations, whereupon the Subject hath been pro≈øecuted and grieved: And that divers Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Super≈øtitions have beene brought into the Church, multitudes driven out of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties Dominions, Jealou≈øies rai≈øed and fomented betwixt the King and His people, a Popi≈øh Army levied in Ireland, and two Armies brought into the bowels of this Kingdome, to the hazzard of His Maje≈øties Royall Per≈øon, the con≈øumption of the Revenues of the Crowne, and Trea≈øure of this Kingdome: And la≈øtly, finding great cau≈øe of Jealou≈øie, that indeavours have been, and are u≈øed to bring the Engli≈øh Army into a mi≈øunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding of this Parliament, thereby to incline that Army, with force to bring to pa≈ø≈øe tho≈øe wicked Coun≈øels, Have therefore thought good to joyne our ≈øelves in a Declaration of our united affections and re≈øolutions.</p>

                  <p>NOte, That becau≈øe ≈øome doubts were rai≈øed by ≈øeverall per≈øons out of the Commons Hou≈øe, concerning the meaning of the≈øe words contained in the Prote≈øtation lately made by the Members of that Hou≈øe, <hi>viz. The true Reformed Prote≈øtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, expre≈ø≈øed in the Doctrine of the Church of England again≈øt all Popery and Popi≈øh Innovations within this Realme, contrary to the ≈øame Doctrine;</hi> The Hou≈øe of Commons did declare, That by tho≈øe words, was and is meant only the publick Doctrine profe≈ø≈øed in the ≈øaid Church, ≈øo farre as it is oppo≈øite to Popery and Popi≈øh Innovations; And that the ≈øaid words are not to be extended to the maintaining of any forme of Wor≈øhip, Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or Government, nor of any Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>MY Lords, The Hou≈øe of Commons have commanded me to pre≈øent unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips this Prote≈øtation: Every member in that Hou≈øe hath made it, not one refu≈øing it; and they have ≈øent it unto your Lord≈øhips, with an a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your Lord≈øhips concurrence in the ≈øame zeale and affection for the publick ≈øafety. And it is their de≈øire your Lord≈øhips would likewi≈øe make the ≈øame Prote≈øtation, which I humbly leave to your Lord≈øhips wi≈ødomes.</p>

                  <head>Directions for more orderly making of the fore≈øaid Prote≈øtation.</head>
                  <p>IT is thought fit that the Prote≈øtation which the Parliament late y made be taken by the Citie of London, in the ≈øeverall Pari≈øh Churches, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon of ≈øome Lords day, after Sermon, before the Congregation bee di≈ø≈øolved, by all Ma≈øters of Families, their ≈øons, and men-≈øervants, in manner and forme following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, That forthwith notice of this intention bee given to the Mini≈øter, Church-wardens, and ≈øome other mee per≈øons of each Pari≈øh in <hi>London,</hi> Liberties, and adjacent Pari≈øhes, and ≈øome of them to give notice to the re≈øt of the Pari≈øhioners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Mini≈øter be entreated (if he plea≈øe) to acquaint his Pari≈øh in his Sermon, either forenoon or aftternoon, with the nature of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øe, more or le≈ø≈øe, as hee ≈øhall think fit, for the better and more ≈øolemne taking of the ≈øaid Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtation; or if the Mini≈øter refu≈øe it, that ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee intreated to preach that will promote the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; or if neither of the≈øe may bee had, that ≈øome other convenient cour≈øe bee taken by ≈øome well affected to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, to ≈øtay the Pari≈øh, and communicate the matter to them.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, That all the Pari≈øhioners above≈øaid, whether in Towne, or out of Towne, be earne≈øtly reque≈øted to bee pre≈øent at their owne Pari≈øh Church in the afternoon of that Lords day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ≈øhall be taken, that every man may take it in their owne place; and if any bee nece≈ø≈øarily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, that they may bee de≈øired to take it the next Lords day after, or ≈øo ≈øoon as may bee with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> his Maje≈øtie, who is the head of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique, and the Father of the Common-wealth, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained fir≈øt, declaring his ≈øen≈øiblene≈ø≈øe of our ≈øufferings, and among≈øt other things, hath put us in mind of our grievances, and hath freely left it to our ≈øelves (for our redre≈ø≈øe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire therein) to begin and end, as we ≈øhall think fit. And this drawes mee on with much cheerefulne≈ø≈øe and zeale to contribute my poore endeavours to ≈øo great a work.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I conceive it will not be altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for your direction and guidance in that great place, which by the favour of his Maje≈øtie, and this Hou≈øe you now po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe, a little to recollect our ≈øelves in the remembrance of what was done the la≈øt Parliament, and where we ended.</p>
               <p>It will likewi≈øe be very con≈øiderable what hath bin done ≈øince that Parliament, and who they are that have beene the Authors and Cau≈øers of all our mi≈øeries and di≈øtractions, both before and ≈øithence.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the la≈øt Parliament, as ≈øoone as the Hou≈øe was ≈øetled, a Sub≈øidiarie ayd and ≈øupply was propounded, and

               <p>On the other ≈øide, a multitude of Complaints and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of all ≈øorts, a≈øwell concerning our Eternall as our Temporall e≈øtates were pre≈øented and put in the other bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance: The wi≈øedome of that great Councell waighing both indifferently, and looking not onely upon the dangers then threatne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it then was, and ≈øtill is, mo≈øt manife≈øt and apparent, that by ≈øome judgements lately obtained in Court of Ju≈øtice, and by ≈øome new wayes of Government lately ≈øt rted up among≈øt us; the Law of property is ≈øo much ≈øhaken, that no man can ≈øay he is Ma≈øter of any thing: But all that we have, wee hold as Tenants by courte≈øie, and at will, and may be ≈øtripped of it at plea≈øure.</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> de≈øirous to give his Maje≈øtie all po≈ø≈øible ≈øatisfaction and contentment, as well in the manner of ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for expedition, as in the ≈øub≈øtance and matter of it, wee confined and limitted our ≈øelves but to three particulars one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ≈øuch matters as properly and naturally ≈øhould have reference and relation to tho≈øe three heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The fir≈øt was the priviledges of Parliament.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The ≈øecond matters of Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The third, the propriety of our goods and E≈øtates.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And we began with the fir≈øt, as the great Ark, in which the other two, Religion and property are included and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the violations complained of the la≈øt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, touching our priviledges, were of two ≈øorts; either ≈øuch as had beene done in Parliament or out of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Concerning the violations of the fir≈øt ≈øort, it was re≈øolved
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:156910:151"/>by vote, that the <hi>Speaker</hi> refu≈øing to put a que≈øtion, being thereunto required by the Hou≈øe,</p>
               <p>Or to adjourne the Hou≈øe upon any command what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without the con≈øent and approbation of the Hou≈øe it ≈øelfe, were breaches and violations that highly impeached our priviledges.</p>
               <p>And having pa≈ø≈øed the vote, I conceive it were fit wee ≈øhould now proceed a little further, and con≈øider of a way how to be repaired again≈øt them that have beene the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: For Execution does <hi>animare Legem.</hi> The putting of an old Law in Execution, you know Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doe more good then the making of a new one.</p>
               <p>As concerning the violations of the other ≈øort, done out of Parliament in Courts of Ju≈øtice, and at the Councell board, where neither our per≈øons nor our proceeding ought to have beene controlled or medled withall: And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of Religion, and the property of our goods and e≈øtates, there were divers things then likewi≈øe agreed upon by vote, whereupon a conference was de≈øired to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>eene with the Lords: But what interjections and rubs wee met withall by the way, and how the Lords countervoted the precedency of our grievances, and how our Speaker was taken away from among≈øt us, and what an unhappy conclu≈øion we had at the la≈øt, the remembrance of it were a ≈øubject too ≈øad to begin another Parliament wi hall.</p>
               <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe from what was done the la≈øt Parliament, and come to what hath beene done ≈øince that Parliament ended.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> there are ≈øome worthy Gentlemen now of this Hou≈øe that were members of the la≈øt Parliament, that carried them≈øelves in the matters and bu≈øine≈ø≈øes then and there agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and debated, with great Wi≈øedome, and unexampled
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:156910:152"/>moderation. But what had they at la≈øt for all their paines, in attending the publique ≈øtrince of the Common-wealth, As ≈øoone as ever the Parliament was ended, their Studies and Pockets were ≈øearched, as if they had beene Fellons and Traytors, and they committed to ≈øeverall Goales, with an intention I am confident of their utter ruine and de≈øtruction, had they not fore-≈øeene a danger approaching; For Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> if I be truly informed, an information was drawne, or at lea≈øt, directions given for the drawing of it, again≈øt them in the Starre-Chamber.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> there hath beene ≈øince the la≈øt Parliament a Synod, and in that Synod a new Oath hath beene made and framed, and enjoyned to be taken.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> they might as wel have made a new Law, and enjoyned the execution of that, as enjoyned and urged the taking of the other, not being e≈øtabli≈øhed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and in point of mi≈øchiefe, the ≈øafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and the freedome and liberties of the Subject are more concerned in the doing of the one, then if they had done the other.</p>
               <p>The next exception I ≈øhall take to it, is to the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Oath it ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> they would have us at the very fir≈øt da≈øh ≈øweare in a damnable Here≈øie, that matters nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are contained in the Di≈øcipline of our Church.</p>
               <p>Whereas Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> it hath ever beene the tenet of our Church, that all things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and contained in the Doctrine of our Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; And that hath alwayes beene u≈øed as an Argument untill this very pre≈øent, again≈øt <hi>Antidi≈øciplinarians,</hi> to ≈øtop their mouthes withall; And therefore that for that rea≈øon they might with the le≈ø≈øe regret and offence, conforme and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:156910:152"/>them≈øelves to the Di≈øcipline of our Church.</p>
               <p>And Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> for prevention in ca≈øe the Wi≈øedome of the State in this great Councell, ≈øhould at any time think fit to alter any thing in the government of our Church, they would anticipate and fore-≈øtall our judgements, by making us ≈øweare before-hand, that wee would never give our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to any alteration.</p>
               <p>Nay Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> they goe a little further, for they would have us ≈øweare, that the government of the Church by Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Deanes, Archdeacons, &amp;c. is <hi>Jure divino,</hi> Their words are, <hi>as of right it ought to ≈øtand;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> wee meet not with the name of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop, or a Deane, or an Arch-deacon in all the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament. And what≈øoever may bee ≈øaid of the Function of Bi≈øhops it is one thing: But for their Juri≈ødiction it is meerely <hi>Humana institutione,</hi> and they mu≈øt thank the King for it.</p>
               <p>As for their gro≈ø≈øe, ab≈øurd, &amp;c. wherein they would have men ≈øweare they know neither what, nor how many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome deepe: There is neither Divinity nor charity in it, and yet they would put that upon us.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> what they meant and intended by this new Oath, and their Booke of Canons, and their Booke of Articles, which they would have our Church-wardens ≈øworne unto, to enquire of, and to pre≈øent thereupon, I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe I know not, unle≈ø≈øe they had a purpo≈øe therein to blow up the Prote≈øtant Religion, and all the faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors of it, and to advance their Hierarchie a ≈øtep higher, which I ≈øuppo≈øe we all feare is high enough already.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> they have likewi≈øe in this Synod granted a benevolence, but the nature of the things agrees not with the name, for in plaine Engli≈øh it is ≈øix Sub≈øidies to be paid
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:156910:153"/>by the Clergie in ≈øix yeares: And the penalty they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed upon the refu≈øers, for none-payment, is to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Functions, to be ≈øtripped of their free-hold, and to be excommunicated, and this Act of their Synod is not publi≈øhed among≈øt their Canons, for which they might have ≈øome colourable ≈øeeming authority: But it comes out, in a Booke alone by it ≈øelfe in the Latine tongue, ≈øuppo≈øing as I conceiue that Lay-men are as ignorant as they would have them; And thus they think they dance in a Net.</p>
               <p>And as in this, ≈øo in mo≈øt of their new Canons if they bee throughly con≈øidered, any judicious man may ea≈øily di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and perceive, that they doe therein like <hi>Water-men</hi> that looke one way and rowe another, they pretend one thing, but intend nothing le≈ø≈øe; And certainly Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> in this they have flowne a high pitch; For a Synod called together upon pretence of reconciling and ≈øetling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øies and matters in Religion, to take upon them the boldne≈ø≈øe thus out of Parliament, to grant Sub≈øidies, and to meddle with mens Free-holds, I dare ≈øay the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before, and they that dur≈øt doe this, will doe wor≈øe if the current of their raging Tyrannie be not ≈øtopped in time.</p>
               <p>Who are they (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have countenanced and cheri≈øhed Popery and Armiani≈øme to that growth and height it is now come to, in this Kingdome?</p>
               <p>Who are they (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have given encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to tho≈øe that have boldly preached tho≈øe damnable Here≈øies in our Pulpits?</p>
               <p>Who are they (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have given authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and licence to them that have publi≈øhed tho≈øe Here≈øies in Print?</p>
               <p>Who are they (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that of late dayes have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:156910:153"/>beene advanced to any dignity or preferment in the Church, but ≈øuch as have beene notoriou≈øly ≈øu≈øpitious in their Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, corrupt in their Doctrines, and for the mo≈øt part, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in their lives?</p>
               <p>And who are they (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that have overthrown our two great Charters, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Forre≈øta?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What impo≈øition hath beene laid downe, or what Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly hath beene damned in any Court of Ju≈øtice ≈øince the la≈øt Parliament?</p>
               <p>Hath not ≈øhip-money, Coale and conduct money, and money for other Military charges, beene collected and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, with as great violence as ever they were, in violation of our liberties, confirmed unto us in our Petition of Right; notwith≈øtanding all our ≈øupplications and complaints the la≈øt Parliament?</p>
               <p>And who are they Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> that have cau≈øed all tho≈øe dangerous Convul≈øions, and all the de≈øperate unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bloudy di≈øtempers, that are now in our body politique?</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I will tell you a pa≈ø≈øage, I heard from a Judge in the Kings-Bench. There was a poore man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Lords, for refu≈øing to ≈øubmit unto a project, and having attended a long time at the Kings-Bench Barre, upon his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and at la≈øt pre≈ø≈øing very earne≈øtly to be bayled, The Judge ≈øaid to the re≈øt of his brethren, Come Brothers (≈øaid he) let us Baile him, for they begin to ≈øay in the Towne, that the Judges have overthrowne the Law, and the Bi≈øhops the Go≈øpell.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I would not be mi≈øunder≈øtood in what I have ≈øaid; for there are ≈øome of both functions and profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I highly honour and reverence in my heart, for their wi≈øedomes and integrities. But Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I may
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:156910:154"/>≈øay it; for I am ≈øure we have all felt it, that there are ≈øome of both functions and profe≈ø≈øions, that have beene the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and cau≈øers of all the Mi≈øeries, Ruines, and Calamities that are now upon us.</p>
               <p>Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> This is the Age; This is the Age (Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker</hi>) that hath produced and brought forth <hi>Achitophells, Hammans, Wool≈øies, Emp≈øons,</hi> and <hi>Dudlies, Tricilians,</hi> and <hi>Belknapps,</hi> Vipers and Mon≈øters of all ≈øorts. And I doubt not, but when his Maje≈øtie ≈øhall be truly enformed of ≈øuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as we are able to charge them withall, wee ≈øhall have the ≈øame Ju≈øtice again≈øt the≈øe, which heretofore hath beene again≈øt their Predece≈ø≈øors, in who≈øe wicked ≈øteps they have trodden.</p>
               <p>And therefore Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> to put our ≈øelves into a way for our redre≈ø≈øe and reliefe, I conceive it were fit that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee might be named to take the≈øe Petitions, that have now beene read, and all others of the like nature, into their con≈øiderations, to the end, that the parties grieved, may have ju≈øt repaire for their grievances; and that out of them, Lawes may be contrived, and framed for the preventing of the like mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, for the future.</p>

               <p>I have had the honour to bee imployed by the Hou≈øe in this great bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, from the fir≈øt houres that it was taken into con≈øideration: it was a matter of great tru≈øt, (and I will ≈øay with confidence) that I have ≈øerved the Hou≈øe in it with indu≈øtry, according to my ability, but with mo≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act faithfulne≈ø≈øe and ≈øecrecie.</p>
               <p>And as I have hitherto di≈øcharged my duty to this Hou≈øe

               <p>I doe wi≈øh the peace of that unto my ≈øelfe, and the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings of <hi>Almighty God</hi> to mee and my po≈øterity, according as my judgement on the life of this man ≈øhall be con≈øonant with my heart, and the be≈øt of my under≈øtanding, in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know well Ma≈øter Speaker, that by ≈øome things I have ≈øaid of late, while≈øt this Bill was in agitation, I have rai≈øed ≈øome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices upon me in the cau≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea ≈øome (I thank them for their plaine dealing) have beene ≈øo free as to tell me, that I ≈øuffered much by the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈ø≈øe I have ≈øhewne in this Bill of <hi>Attainder</hi> of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> again≈øt whom I had beene formerly ≈øo keene, ≈øo active.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I beg of you and the re≈øt but a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of judgement concerning me, till I have opened my heart unto you freely and clearly in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Truely Sir, I am ≈øtill the ≈øame in my opinions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as unto the Earle of <hi>Srafford,</hi> I confidently beleeve him the mo≈øt dangerous Mini≈øter, the mo≈øt in≈øupportable to free Subjects, that can be character'd.</p>
               <p>I beleeve his practi≈øes in them≈øelves as high, as tyrannicall, as any Subject ever ventured on, and the malignity of them hugely aggravated by tho≈øe rare abilities of his, whereof God hath given him the u≈øe, but the Devill the application. <hi>In a word,</hi> I beleeve him ≈øtil that grand <hi>Apo≈øtate</hi> to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> who mu≈øt not expect to be pardoned it in this world, till hee be di≈øpatch'd to the other. And yet let mee tell you Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> my hand mu≈øt not be to that di≈øpatch.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:156910:155"/>
                  <hi>I prote≈øt, as my Con≈øcience ≈øtands enformed, I had rather it were off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let me unfold unto you the Mysterie, Ma≈øter Speaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not dwell much upon ju≈øtifying unto you my ≈øeeming variance at this time from what I was formerly, by putting you in mind of the difference betweene Pro≈øecutors and Judges,</p>
               <p>How misbecomming that fervour would be in a <hi>Judge,</hi> which perhaps was commendable in a <hi>Pro≈øecutor. Judges</hi> we are now, and mu≈øt put on another Per≈øonage.</p>
               <p>It is hone≈øt and noble to be earne≈øt in order to the di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Truth, but when that hath beene brought as farre as it can to light, our judgement thereupon ought to be calme and cautious.</p>
               <p>In pro≈øecution upon probable grounds, we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able onely for our indu≈øtry or remi≈øne≈ø≈øe, but in judgement, we are deeply re≈øpon≈øable to God Almighty, for its rectitude or obliquity. In ca≈øes of life, the <hi>Judge</hi> is Gods Steward of the parties bloud, and mu≈øt give a ≈øtrict account for every drop.</p>
               <p>But as I told you Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I will not in≈øi≈øt long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground of difference in mee now, from what I was formerly.</p>
               <p>The truth on't is, Sir the ≈øame ground whereupon I (with the re≈øt of the five, to whom you fir≈øt committed the con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi>) brought downe our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it was fit he ≈øhould be accu≈øed of Trea≈øon, upon the ≈øame ground I was engaged with earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe in his pro≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had the ≈øame ground remained in that force of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe with me, which till very lately it did, I ≈øhould not have beene tender in his condemnation. But truly Sir, to deale
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:156910:156"/>plainly with you, that ground of our accu≈øation, that ≈øpurre to our pro≈øecution, and that which ≈øhould be the ba≈øis of my judgement, of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as unto Trea≈øon, is to my under≈øtanding quite vani≈øht away.</p>
               <p>This it was, Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His advi≈øing the King to employ the Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to reduce <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I was a≈ø≈øured would be proved, before I gave my con≈øent to his accu≈øation. I was confirmed in the ≈øame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, during the pro≈øecution, and fortified in it mo≈øt of all ≈øince Sir <hi>Henry Vaines</hi> preparatory examinations, by the a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances which that worthy member Mr. <hi>Pymme</hi> gave me, that his Te≈øtimony would be made convincing by ≈øome notes of what pa≈ø≈øed at the <hi>Junto</hi> concurrent with it, which I ever under≈øtanding to be of ≈øome other Coun≈øellour, you ≈øee now prove but a Copie of the ≈øame Secretaries notes, di≈øcover'd and produc't in the manner you have heard, and tho≈øe, <hi>Such di≈øioynted fragments of the venemous part of di≈øcour≈øes, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øults, no conclu≈øions of Coun≈øels, which are the onely things that Secretaries ≈øhould regi≈øter, there being no u≈øe at all of the other, but to accu≈øe and to bring men into danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sir, this is not that which overthrowes the evidence with mee, concerning the Army of <hi>Ireland;</hi> nor yet that all the re≈øt of the <hi>Iunto</hi> upon their oathes remember nothing of it.</p>
               <p>But this Sir, which I ≈øhall tell you, is that which works with mee under favour, to an utter overthrow of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as unto that of the Army of <hi>Ireland: Before, whil'≈øt I was a pro≈øecutor, and under tye of Secrecie, I might not di≈øcover any weakene≈ø≈øe of the cau≈øe, which now as a Judge I mu≈øt.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter Secretary was examined thrice upon Oath, at the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Committee.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:156910:156"/>
               <p>The fir≈øt time he was que≈øtioned to all the <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> and to that part of the ≈øeventh which concernes the Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ≈øaid po≈øitively in the≈øe words, <hi>I cannot charge him with that. But for the re≈øt, he de≈øires time to recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, which was granted him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some dayes after, he was examined a ≈øecond time, and then depo≈øes the≈øe words concerning the Kings being ab≈øolved from rules of government, and ≈øo forth very clearely. <hi>But being pre≈øt to that part, concerning the</hi> Iri≈øh <hi>Army, againe can ≈øay nothing to that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here wee thought wee had done with him, till divers weeks after, my Lord of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and all others of the <hi>Junto,</hi> denying to have heard any thing concerning tho≈øe words of reducing <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Army, it was thought fit to examine the Secretary once more, and then he depo≈øes the≈øe words to have beene ≈øaid by the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> to his Maje≈øtie: <hi>You have an Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which you may imploy here to reduce, (or ≈øome word to that ≈øence) this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the≈øe are the circum≈øtances which I confe≈ø≈øe with my Con≈øcience, thru≈øt quite out of dores that grand Article of our charge, concerning his de≈øperate advice to the King, of employing the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Army here.</p>
               <p>Let not this, I be≈øeech you, be driven to an a≈øper≈øion upon Ma≈øter Secretary, as if he ≈øhould have ≈øworn otherwi≈øe then he knew or beleeved, hee is too worthy to doe that; onely let thus much be inferr'd from it, that hee who twice upon Oath with time of recollection, could not remember any thing of ≈øuch a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, might well a third time mi≈øremem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ≈øomewhat: and in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe the difference of one Letter, here for there, or that for this, quite alters the ca≈øe, the latter al≈øo being the more probable, ≈øince it is confe≈øt of all hands, that the debate then was concerning a warre with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:156910:157"/>
                  <hi>Scotland,</hi> and you may remember that at the Bar he once ≈øaid to employ there. And thus Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have faithfully given you an account what it is that hath blunted the edge of the Hatchet or Bill with me towards my Lord of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was that whereupon I accu≈øed him with a free heart, pro≈øecuted him with earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe, and had it to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding beene proved, ≈øhould have condemned him with innocence. Whereas now I cannot ≈øatisfie my con≈øcience to doe it.</p>
               <p>I profe≈ø≈øe I can have no notion of any bodies intent to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Lawes trea≈øonably, or by force; and this de≈øigne of force not appearing, all his other wicked practi≈øes cannot amount ≈øo high with me.</p>
               <p>I can finde a more ea≈øie and more naturall ≈øpring, from whence to derive all his other Crimes, then from an intent to bring in Tyrannie, and to make his owne po≈øterity as well as us, Slaves, as from revenge, from Pride, from Avarice, from Pa≈ø≈øion, and in≈øolence of Nature.</p>
               <p>But had this of the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Army been proved, it would have diffu≈øed a complexion of Trea≈øon, over all, it would have beene a With indeed, to bind all tho≈øe other ≈øcattered and le≈ø≈øer branches, as it were into a Faggot of Trea≈øon.</p>
               <p>I doe not ≈øay but the re≈øt may repre≈øent him a man as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to dye, and perhaps worthier then many a Traytor. I doe not ≈øay, but they may ju≈øtly direct us to <hi>Enact</hi> that they ≈øhall be Trea≈øon for the future.</p>
               <p>But God keepe mee from giving judgement of death on any Man, and of ruine to his innocent Po≈øterity, upon a Law made <hi>√¢ po≈øteriori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the mark be ≈øet on the dore where the Plague is, and then let him that will enter dye.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:156910:157"/>
               <p>I know Ma≈øter <hi>Speaker,</hi> there is in <hi>Parliament</hi> a double power of life and death by Bill, a judiciall power, and a Legi≈ølative: the mea≈øure of the one, is what's Legally ju≈øt, of the other, what is prudentially and politickly fit for the good and pre≈øervation of the whole. But tho≈øe two, under favour, are not to be confounded in Judgement. Wee mu≈øt not peece up want of Legality with matter of convenience, nor the defailance of prudentiall fitne≈ø≈øe, with a pretence of legall Ju≈øtice.</p>
               <p>To condemne my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> judicially as for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, my con≈øcience is not a≈ø≈øured that the matter will bear it.</p>
               <p>And to doe it by the Legi≈ølative power, my rea≈øon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øultively cannot agree to that, <hi>≈øince</hi> I <hi>am per≈øwaded, neither the Lords nor the King will pa≈ø≈øe the Bill, and con≈øequently that our pa≈ø≈øing it will be a cau≈øe of great divi≈øions and combu≈øtions in the State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore my humble advice is, that laying a≈øide this Bill of <hi>Attainder,</hi> we may think of another, ≈øaving only life, ≈øuch as may ≈øecure the State from my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering it, as much by divi≈øion concerning his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, as he hath endangered it by his practices.</p>
               <p>If this may not be hearkned unto, let me conclude in ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that unto you all, which I have throughly inculcated to mine owne con≈øcience upon this occa≈øion. <hi>Let every man lay his hand upon his heart, and ≈øadly con≈øider what we are going to doe, with a breath, either ju≈øtice or murther; justice on the one ≈øide, or murther heightned and aggravated to its ≈øupreame≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> For as the <hi>Ca≈øui≈øts</hi> ≈øay, that he who lyes with his ≈øi≈øter commits ince≈øt, but he that marries his ≈øi≈øter ≈øinnes higher, by applying Gods Ordinance to his crime: <hi>So doubtle≈ø≈øe he that commits murther with the ≈øword of Ju≈øtice, heightens that crime to the utmo≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The danger being ≈øo great, and the ca≈øe ≈øo doubtfull, that I ≈øee the be≈øt Lawyers in <hi>diametrall oppo≈øition</hi> concerning it,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:156910:158"/>Let every man wipe his heart, as he does his eyes, when hee would judge of a nice and ≈øubtile object. <hi>The eye, if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincted with any colour, is vitiated in its di≈øcerning. Let us take heed of a blood-≈øhotten-eye of Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let every man purge his heart cleare of all pa≈ø≈øions, (I know this great and wi≈øe body politick can have none, but I ≈øpeak to inviduals from the weakne≈ø≈øe which I finde in my ≈øelfe.) Away with per≈øonall animo≈øities, away with all flatteries to the people, in being the ≈øharper again≈øt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he is odious to them; away with all feares, le≈øt by the ≈øparing his bloud they may be incen≈øt; away with all ≈øuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderations, as that it is not fit for a <hi>Parliament, that one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed by it of Trea≈øon ≈øhould e≈øcape with life.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Of all the≈øe corruptives of judgement, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I doe before God di≈øcharge my ≈øelf to the uttermo≈øt of my power,</p>
               <p>And doe with a cleare Con≈øcience wa≈øh my hands of this mans blood, by this ≈øolemne prote≈øtation, that my Vote goes not to the taking of the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> life.</p>

We are called hither Ma≈øter Speaker by the Royall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we ≈øit here by the Kings Maje≈øties grace and favour, and ≈øince his Maje≈øty hath beene graciou≈øly plea≈øed to leave the government of all in our hands, I doubt not but we ≈øhall lay ≈øuch a foundation in the beginning of this Parliament, that we ≈øhall make it a happy Age, a long la≈øting one ≈øince the dangers of the≈øe times, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent di≈øtempers of this State, and therein both his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie, and our nece≈ø≈øities, yea and the whole Kingdomes ≈øafety do require it.</p>
               <p>We are called now, Ma≈øter Speaker, as I conceive from the reports you have made of his Maje≈øties gracious Declaration, for foure principall cau≈øes. Fir≈øt, for ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of his Maje≈øties wants. Secondly, for the relief of our Brethren in the Northern parts. Thirdly, for the remove
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:156910:187"/>of the <hi>Scots</hi> forces. Fourthly, for redre≈ø≈øe of ourowne grievances. That his Maje≈øties wants are great and many, Ma≈øter Speaker, I thinke there is no man doubts it; and it is as cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ain out grievances are ≈øo to, they are great and many both in Church and Common-wealth; I ≈øhall but touch them in either, ≈øince they have been ≈øo fully remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrated in both.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt in the Church, by the u≈øurping power of ≈øome Prelates and their adherents, by which means many great dangers, innovations of doctrines, of di≈øcipline, of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have been thru≈øt upon us.</p>
               <p>Secondly in the Church, by publique ≈øufferances of Prie≈øts and Je≈øuits, not only to come into the land, by which means the number of Romi≈øh Catholiks are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerou≈øly multiplied, Idolatry increa≈øed, and Gods heavie judgements highly provoked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in the Common-wealth, by the late inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prerogative Royall, which have broken out, and almo≈øt overturned all our liberties, even tho≈øe which have been be≈øt and ≈øtronge≈øt fortified, the <hi>Grand Chartea</hi> it ≈øelf. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Speaker, that which hath been ≈øo oft, ≈øo ≈øolemnly confirmed in the Succe≈ø≈øion of ≈øo many Princes, ratified in his Maje≈øties name, founded by the wi≈øedome of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, purpo≈øely to keepe the beame over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>Even this Ma≈øter Speaker, the deare≈øt and chiefe≈øt part of our inheritance hath been infringed, broken, and ≈øet at nought in the Common-wealth by the over-potencie of ≈øome faire great ones, ≈øacred Councellors of State; by who≈øe advices it is thought the greate≈øt part of the≈øe pre≈øent di≈øtempers, under which the body of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth at this time labours, doe deprive their originalls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly in the Common-wealth, by the mi≈øchievous practi≈øes and policies of ≈øome ≈øubtill Projectors, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of the Kings profit, and the publique good;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:156910:187"/>they have entitled them≈øelves to great and va≈øt e≈øtates, and that by the dammage of the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>They are Ma≈øter Speaker, the very moths and cankers that have fretten and eaten out all Trade and commerce, the very beauty, ≈øtrength, and health of this famous I≈øland.</p>
               <p>In the Common-wealth, by the entertainment of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners and ≈øtrangers, and that at his Maje≈øties exce≈ø≈øive charge, by which means his Maje≈øties Coffers are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, his Revenues ≈øhortned, and the whole Kingdome many other wayes oppre≈ø≈øed. But Ma≈øter Speaker, I ≈øhall not trouble my ≈øelfe any further in ≈øo va≈øt, ≈øo large a field; I ≈øhall now repre≈øent my owne weak apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for our progre≈ø≈øions in all the particulars for which we have been called, and in all humility ≈øubmit unto them.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, of ≈øupply in his Maje≈øties wants, I do humbly de≈øire we may proceed there within its due time; and that with as much loyall dutie and liberality, as ever any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expre≈ø≈øed towards their Prince, I think I may ≈øay the pre≈øent affairs of the Kingdome require it.</p>
               <p>For the reliefe of our Brethren in the Northern parts, with a ≈øen≈øe of charity, and fellow feeling of the mi≈øeries, afflictions, and lo≈ø≈øes, In the removing of the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie with a ≈øoft and gentle hand of mediation, purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reconciliation, if po≈ø≈øible it may be wrought with his Maje≈øties honor, and the Kingdomes ≈øafety (if not) then to repell and repul≈øe them with ≈øtout and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ≈øpirits, with valiant and united hearts and hands, ≈øuch as ≈øhall be≈øt ≈øuite with our duty to God, our King, our Country; ≈øuch as ≈øhall be≈øt become his honor, and ancient renowne of this Engli≈øh Nation.</p>
               <p>In redre≈ø≈øe of our grievances in tho≈øe of the Church, which ought to have priority in our con≈øultation; as well in re≈øpect of nece≈ø≈øity, as dignity. In the≈øe Ma≈øter Speaker, I do humbly de≈øire, and doubt not but we ≈øhall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:156910:188"/>proceed with all true piety, and well grounded on each guiding Helve towards Gods Hou≈øe, and his truth. In tho≈øe of the Communalty, with a religious care of our Countries freedom, in the faithfull performance of the tru≈øt repo≈øed in us, by them that ≈øent us, in the pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our rights, our ancient rights, the rights of our inheritance, our liberties, our priviledges, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
               <p>Yet in all, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I do humbly de≈øire we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as be≈øt ≈øuiting the matter and condition of the≈øe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempered times, or as be≈øt becoming the honour, dignity, and wi≈øedom of this ≈øo great a Court, ≈øo great Councell, with all temper, mode≈øty, and all due moderation.</p>

               <p>And Ma≈øter Speaker, the thoughts of the righteous are right, but the coun≈øells of the wicked are deceits, and nothing el≈øe in their hearts but de≈øtructions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va≈øtations, but to the coun≈øellors of peace is joy, ≈øo long as they kept them≈øelves within the circle of the ≈øpirituall commerce, and ≈øtudied to keepe mens hearts upright to God, and his Truth; there was no ≈øuch complaining in our Streets of them, nor had we never ≈øeene ≈øo many thou≈øand hands again≈øt them as now there are come in.

               <p>Ma≈øter Speaker, I ≈øhall not goe about to overthrow their government in the plurall, but to limit it, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it in ≈øome particulars. For Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> long ≈øince well ob≈øerved there two things in the government of Bi≈øhops, of which he could never be ≈øatisfied, no more can I; the fir≈øt was the ≈øole exerci≈øes of the authorities.</p>
               <p>And ≈øecondly, by the deputation of that authority.</p>
               <p>But Ma≈øter Speaker, I ≈øhall not now di≈øpute of either, for mine own part Ma≈øter Speaker, I love ≈øome of them ≈øo well, and am ≈øo charitable to the re≈øt, that I wi≈øh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their reformation, then their ruine.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you withall, that if we ≈øhould finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them any proud <hi>Becket,</hi> or <hi>Wol≈øey</hi> Prelates, who ≈øtick not to write <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus.</hi> Or if there ≈øhall be ≈øound any cruell <hi>Bonners,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øuch I confe≈ø≈øe I would not ≈øpare, for they will ≈øpare none.

               <p>But Ma≈øter Speaker, we mu≈øt al≈øo be Actors in the pre≈øervations of Religions concordance, which wil never be ≈øafe, nor well at quiet, untill the≈øe heavy dro≈ø≈øie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons with all their ba≈øe mettall be melted and di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; let us then di≈ømount them, and de≈øtroy them, which is my humble motion.</p>

               <p>BY the report made from the Committee of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you may ≈øee to what exorbitant height Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie is growne, and yet how ≈ølowly we go on to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe it. I feare God is di≈øplea≈øed with us, or el≈øe no di≈øa≈øter ≈øhould have prevented the ≈øealing of our Covenant, when intended, and I hope it ≈øhall be performed the next Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Had our Fa≈øt beene accepted, and our Humiliation Cordiall, no blow ≈øhould have di≈øtracted our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Ma≈øter Speaker, if we had taken the good Coun≈øell of our Teachers at the Fa≈øt, and beleeved their Report, we had done well; and by this time (no doubt) we might have found out <hi>Achan</hi> with his Wedge of Godl, and Babiloni≈øh garment. But we have ≈øpent our time onely in peeling of the Barke,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:156910:191"/>and ≈ønatching the boughes and branches of Poperie, and that will doe us no good, for they will prove, and grow thicker and harder.</p>
               <p>What mu≈øt we do then, Ma≈øter Speaker, to pre≈øerve our Religion ≈øafe and ≈øound to us and to our Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that our Candle≈øticke be not removed. The only way is to fall to our worke in earne≈øt, and lay the Axe to the Root, to unloo≈øe the long and deepe fangs of Poperie and Super≈øtition, which being once done, the bodie will ≈øoone fall downe.</p>
               <p>Let us then Ma≈øter Speaker, endeavour a through Reformation; for if it be imperfect, it will prove the ≈øeed of di≈ø≈øolution, if not di≈ø≈øolutions, which God forbid. and to prevent it, I ≈øhall humbly move that the Groves and High-places of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may be removed and put down, and then Gods wrath will be appea≈øed, and till then never.</p>

                  <salute>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>
                  </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THe≈øe two honorable Lords, Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> that ≈øpake la≈øt, have not only prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in much I intended to have ≈øpoken my ≈øelf, but they have likewi≈øe taught me much I knew not before; Therefore it is not much you can expect from me: All that I ≈øhall ≈øay at this time, is rather to prepare the matter for the que≈øtion, which hath already been ≈øo learnedly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, than to ≈øpeak any thing of the matter it ≈øelf. I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe, when I look upon the Bi≈øhops, or at lea≈øt, upon ≈øome of them, and the way of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ≈øufferings of the people, under their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: I wonder not at all at the multitude of Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Petitions, that have this Parliament been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again≈øt them, and that they all cry out, Crucifie Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, or that they would have been up by the roots, but it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:156910:192"/>is nece≈ø≈øary we ≈øhould di≈øtingui≈øh between the per≈øons of the Bi≈øhops, which are ≈øo obnoxious, and their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Offices; for there is no more weight in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that becau≈øe the Bi≈øhops have done ami≈ø≈øe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take away Epi≈øcopacy, than there is in it, becau≈øe the Judges of the Common Law are in fault, therefore take away Judges, and take away the Common Law: For my own part; I conceive it an ea≈øier matter, and ≈øafer for us, <hi>(Addere Inventis)</hi> to reform what is ami≈ø≈øe in them and their Government, then <hi>(Creare Novum)</hi> to ≈øet up a new form of Goverment, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have had no experience of, nor do we know how it ≈øhould ≈øuit either with the humours of the people, or with the Monarchiall Government; And it may be the new Government which is ≈øo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired, if it be brought in upon the grounds and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ≈øome would have it, it will be out of our powers ever to mini≈øter it again. Whereas on the other ≈øide, the Government which is already e≈øtabli≈øhed, if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours exceed their bounds, they may fall into a <hi>Premuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> and other penalties which the Law hath provided in that Ca≈øe; and if that be not ≈øufficient, we have yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hanck upon them, for our Parliaments have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a command over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then, Sir,</hi> It may be demanded of me of their being ≈øo much ami≈ø≈øe, what is that I would have done?</p>
               <p>Truely Sir, I am of opinion, that much mu≈øt be done, or el≈øe we had as good do nothing.</p>
               <p>Therefore I come to the particulars, Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be compared to a Ca≈øtle, let a Ca≈øtle be never ≈øo ≈øtrong, once in four-≈øcore yeers (for ≈øo long it is ≈øince the fir≈øt reformation) it may need repair, and it is not the Ca≈øtle alone, I mean the Government, that needs repair, but likewi≈øe the Governours them≈øelves, who mo≈øt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and trayterou≈øly have turned their Canons upon us, which ≈øhould have been u≈øed for our defence.</p>
               <p>In the fir≈øt place therefore I conceive it not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:156910:193"/>but of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity, and the payring of their excre≈øcences, I mean their temporall Juri≈ødiction: I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe, I know not to what purpo≈øe they ≈øhould ≈øit upon our Benches at our Se≈ø≈øions of the Peace, and Goal-Deliveries, or in the Starre-Chamber, for by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience, we finde that their Judgements are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there more by their boundle≈ø≈øe wills, and fiery tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported pa≈ø≈øions, than by rea≈øon, and the rule of Law, which ought to have been their director. I conceive that of le≈ø≈øe u≈øe their ≈øitting at the Councell boord, to be there at the Helm to guide and ≈øteer the temporall affairs of the Common-wealth, certainly that is not the Plough they ought to follow, and by the neglecting of it, that is the rea≈øon that ≈øo many briers, brambles, and ≈øtinking weeds, are ≈øprung up in Gods Hou≈øe, the Church, to the great de≈øtruction of all his Maje≈øties Kingdoms here at home, and the great wonder and amazement of all the reformed Churches abroad.</p>
               <p>And I conceive it of the lea≈øt u≈øe of all their ≈øitting in Parliaments, as powers to give their voices in the making of Laws; and yet I would not utterly exclude them. For I conceive it might be convenient that all, or at lea≈øt, ≈øome of them might alway be pre≈øent there as A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, to give their advice in Spirituall matters when they are thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to required by the Lords, as the Ju≈øtices do in Temporall.</p>
               <p>In the next place I conceive it of, as ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity, the robbing of the Juri≈ødiction of the high Commi≈ø≈øion Court, or at lea≈øt, to limit and bound it, that it may <hi>(quadrare)</hi> with the great <hi>Charter</hi> of our liberties, and the Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This Court hath for many yeers together, ridden upon the back of the common Law Courts, which ought to have been ≈øub≈øervient to them. Each river mu≈øt be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its, own bounds, and it is unpo≈ø≈øible to have two Suns ≈øhine together in one Firmament.</p>
               <p>They have likewi≈øe many ≈øuperfluous Courts, which I
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:156910:193"/>conceive might very well be ≈øpared, as their Officiall Courts, and Commi≈ø≈øary Courts. Sir, they are no better than cozening Lotteries, where the Kings Subjects are detained of their moneyes, and where their Judges and inferiour Officers do, like Phy≈øitians that alway cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, though they de≈øtroy their patients. I confe≈ø≈øe, I could willingly give my con≈øent that they ≈øhould keep their Chancellors Court, and an Archdeacon Court, if ≈øuch limits and bounds were put upon them, as by the wi≈øedom of this Hou≈øe may ea≈øily be done.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor is <hi>(cu≈øtos con≈øciencie)</hi> the Keeper of the Bi≈øhops con≈øcience, and the Archdeacon is <hi>(oculus Epi≈øc.)</hi> the Bi≈øhops eye; And as I would not take away their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences or their eyes, ≈øo I would not have them like <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius</hi> have their finger in every bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. This Sir, I have ≈øhortly pre≈øented you with my opinion, that is, that I am not willing it that ≈øhould be referred to, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the point of ≈øubver≈øion, but I am willing it ≈øhould be referred upon the point of reformation. And if the ≈øence of the Hou≈øe ≈øhall run that way, I doubt not but at the Commitree I ≈øhall make it manife≈øt, that my heart ≈øtands affected with as much zeal, for the having a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any man that ≈øits within the≈øe walls.</p>

               <p>A Bi≈øhop, my <hi>Lords,</hi> is not ≈øo circum≈øcribed within the circumference of his Dioce≈ø≈øe, that his ≈øometimes ab≈øence can be termed, not in the mo≈øt ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe a neglect or hindrance of his duty, no more than that of a Zievetenant from his Count y, they both have their ≈øubordinate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters, upon which their influences fall, though the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance be remote.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:156910:199"/>good, to make whole≈øome and good Lawes for the happy and well regulating of the Church and Common-wealth, is certainly more advantagious to both, then the want of the per≈øonall execution of their office, and that but once in three years, and then peradventure but a moneth or two, can be prejudiciall to either. I will go no further to this, which experience hath done ≈øo fully, ≈øo demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
               <p>And now my <hi>Lords,</hi> by your Lord≈øhips good leave, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to the con≈øequence, as it reflects both on your Lord≈øhips, and my Lords the Bi≈øhops.

               <p>And for the Bi≈øhops, my Lords, in what condition will you leave them? The Hou≈øe of Commons repre≈øents the meane≈øt per≈øon, ≈øo did the Ma≈øter his ≈ølave, but they have none to do ≈øo much for them, and what ju≈øtice can tie them to the ob≈øervation of tho≈øe Lawes, to who≈øe con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution they give no con≈øent, the wi≈ødome of former times, gave proxies unto this Hou≈øe meerly upon this ground, that every one might have a hand in the making of that, which he had an obligation to obey: This Hou≈øe could not repre≈øent, therefore proxies in roome of per≈øons were mo≈øt ju≈øtly allowed.</p>
               <p>And now my <hi>Lords,</hi> before I conclude, I be≈øeech your Lord≈øhips to ca≈øt your eyes upon the Church, which I

               <p>I never read of any of them, Civill, or Barbarous, that gave not thus much to their Religion, ≈øo that it ≈øeems to me to have no other originall, to flow from no other ≈øpring than Nature it ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>But I have done, and will trouble your Lord≈øhips no longer, how it may ≈øtand with honor and ju≈øtice of this Hou≈øe to pa≈ø≈øe this Bill, I mo≈øt humbly ≈øubmit unto your Lord≈øhips, the mo≈øt proper and only Juges of them both.</p>

               <p>I Shall not ≈øpeake to the Preamble of the Bill, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, and Clergie men ought not to intermeddle in temporall offairs.

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:156910:200"/>to prove the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of their intermedling by the former, would be to no more purpo≈øe, than to labour to convince that by rea≈øon, which is evident to ≈øen≈øe. It is by all acknowledged. The unlawfulne≈ø≈øe by the latter, the bill by no means admits of, for, it excepts Univer≈øities and ≈øuch per≈øons as ≈øhall have honour de≈øcend upon them. And your Lord≈øhips know, that circum≈øtance and chance alter not the nature and e≈ø≈øence of a thing, nor can except any particular from an univer≈øall propo≈øition by God him≈øelf delivered. I will therefore take the≈øe two as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fir≈øt that they ought by our Law to intermeddle in temporall affairs, ≈øecondly, that from doing ≈øo they are not inhibited by the Law of God, it leaves it at lea≈øt as a thing indifferent.

               <p>My Lords, the politike body of the Common-wealth is analogicall to the body naturall: every member in that contributes ≈øomething to the contribution of the whole, the ≈øuperfluity or defect which hinders the performance of that duty, your Lord≈øhips know what the Philo≈øopher calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I A≈ø≈øure my ≈øelfe, we are here met to di≈øcover, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme (as much as in us lyeth) all abu≈øes of the Church and Common-wealth; many and great ones have been ≈øpoken again≈øt, ≈øome contrary to all Law, and ≈øome e≈øtabli≈øhed by new Lawes, contrary to all Law: The Wolfe having put on the Lions skinne, and rapine, pre≈øuming to pa≈ø≈øe undi≈øcovered under the robe of Ju≈øtice. But I ≈øhall not neede to light a candle to ≈øearch out that, which already the ≈øunne hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt; That which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak, hath not been ≈øpoken, but if I ≈øhall ≈øpeak that. that ≈øhall ≈øeeme to be again≈øt Law, I humbly crave the pardon of this Hou≈øe, ≈øince if it be law, it is <hi>≈øummum jus,</hi> Law without con≈øcience: That which I ≈øhall ≈øpeake again≈øt, is the Oath <hi>Ex Officio.</hi> It is acknowledged by them≈øelves, that Admini≈øter this Oath that it is unju≈øtly done to tender it to any man, unle≈ø≈øe there be a publique Fame, or particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentment or Articles te≈øtified again≈øt him: I make no que≈øtion, but the practice of this confe≈øt Injunction wil be found co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon among≈øt them, And I hope it ≈øhalbe ≈øeverely cen≈øured, ≈øince unju≈øt proceedings upon unju≈øt grounds, are double Inju≈øtice; I ≈øhall therefore leave that as a plaine ca≈øe, and examine their be≈øt grounds; Fir≈øt, Fame (they ≈øay) is a ju≈øt cau≈øe for them to take Cognizance of a matter to proceed again≈øt it; Fame we
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:156910:203"/>know may ari≈øe upon very ≈ømall and groundle≈ø≈øe ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpitions, by ≈øecret whi≈øperings, creeping at fir≈øt, but quickly gets it wings; And as the Po√´t ≈øaith, <hi>Cre≈øeit eundo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the manner of all Fame; if this be Fame, their Court ≈øhall never want worke, as long as a Promooter hath an ill tongue, or a knave can ≈ølander an hone≈øt man; Therefore I thinke Fame no good ground to proceed upon.</p>
               <p>If Fame be ju≈øt, what mo≈øt men ≈øpeake, certainly ≈øome men will te≈øtifie; No man will te≈øtifie it is fal≈øe.</p>
               <p>Let no accu≈øation then ≈øtand, but out of the mouthes of two or three witne≈ø≈øes, of Pre≈øentments, are a ju≈øt ground of proceedings in all Courts, and upon all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes: But neither witne≈ø≈øes nor pre≈øentments are or can be a ju≈øt ground of the Oath <hi>Ex officio;</hi> For if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie accu≈øed be examined no further then is te≈øtified, then the Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> is ≈øuperfluous.</p>
               <p>If he be examined further, or upon other matters then is te≈øtified, then a man is made to betray him≈øelfe, which is unju≈øt.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Speaker, ≈øuch is the Mercy of the Common Law, that Murderers and Poy≈øoners are not examined upon the rack, but the Civill law upon every occa≈øion rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Con≈øcience.</p>
               <p>The≈øe are the Lyme-twigs which were ≈øet to catch the poore Martyrs in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies; And in our daies, I dare beleeve it will appeare that ≈øome good men are fallen into this ≈ønare.</p>

               <p>THe principall part of this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, is Moneys, and now we are about it, I ≈øhall be glad we may give ≈øo much, as will not only ≈øerve the turn for the pre≈øent, but likewi≈øe to provide that it come not quick upon us againe, I beleeve that the two ≈øub≈øidies are ≈øpent alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Wee know how much time this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe hath co≈øt us, if we be but halfe as long about another, it may co≈øt more then money: For if two Armies ≈øhould be driven to extreame nece≈ø≈øitie, and they will be Judges of their owne nece≈ø≈øitie, we ≈øhall not be able to ≈øit here, and give more, though we would.</p>
               <p>Believe it Sir; this is the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of all the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes in the Hou≈øe, of all the bu≈øine≈ø≈øes in the Kingdom; If we ≈øtand hacking for a little money, wee may very thriftily lo≈øe all we have, this being a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of ≈øo peremptory and de≈øtructive a nature.</p>

               <p>Foure ≈øub≈øidies will doe the worke, if they be given pre≈øently, for every day tells us that we are not ≈øo much Ma≈øters of our owne time, and occa≈øions as to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when we would; Let us doe this while≈øt we may, though I dwell not in the North, yet I dwell in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The ≈øecond rea≈øon is from circum≈øtance, or rather <hi>√† Con≈øuetudine,</hi> and of this there are many examples both dome≈øtique and forain; but more particularly by the Parliaments of France abbreviated into a ≈øtanding Committee by <hi>Philip</hi> the King, and continued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his In≈øtitution untill <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh came to the Crown, who being a ≈øubtill Prince buried the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume in the Epitome, for to this day, when ever the three E≈øtates are called, either at the death of the old King, or to Crown the new, It is a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <hi>Allons voire Le van des E≈øtates;</hi> My Lords Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgements de≈øtroy the Common Laws, and in them the two great Charters of the Kingdome, which being once lo≈øt, we have nothing left but the name of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Then the la≈øt rea≈øon is (though it was the fir≈øt cau≈øe of my ≈øtanding up) the great Eclip≈øe it hath ever been to the whole Nobility; For who are ≈øo frequently vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there as Peers and Noblemen, and notwith≈øtanding their appeale to this A≈ø≈øembly, is ever good whil≈øt that famous Law of the 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. remaines in force for the holding of a Parliament once a year or more if occa≈øion require, yet who dur≈øt a year ago mention ≈øuch a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, without the incurring the danger of M. <hi>Kilverts</hi> per≈øecution?

               <p>The Hou≈øes did further informe, that ≈øome Je≈øuits and Prie≈øts had been executed in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory; and when any of them have received mercy, it was in ≈øuch time, and upon ≈øuch circum≈øtance, as that the ≈øame might be extended unto them without dangers, whereas now of late, there hath been a great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of endevours by ≈øome ill agents, to ≈øubvert Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

               </head>
               <p>I Rejoyce very much to ≈øee this day; and the want hath not lain in my affections, but my lungs. If to all that hath bind pa≈øt, I have not been as loud with my voice as any mans in the hou≈øe, yet truly my opinion is; we have yet done nothing, if we doe no more: I ≈øhall add what I humbly conceive ought to be added, as ≈øoone as I have ≈øaid ≈øomething, with references to him that ≈øaies it: I will fir≈øt de≈øire the forgivene≈ø≈øe of the Hou≈øe, if ought I ≈øay ≈øeem to entrench upon anothers profe≈ø≈øion, and enter upon the work of another robe.</p>
               <p>Since I have bin intru≈øted by the report of a learned Committee, and confirmed by the uncontradicted rule of the Hou≈øe, ≈øince I ≈øhall ≈øay nothing of this kind, but in order to ≈øomewhat further.</p>
               <p>And which moves me mo≈øt to venture my opinion, and to expect your pardon, ≈øince I am confident, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory alone is ≈øufficient to ≈øhew this judgement contrary to our Laws, and Logick alone ≈øufficient to prove it de≈øtructive to our propriety, which every free, and noble per≈øon values more then his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. I will not profe≈ø≈øe I know of my ≈øelfe, and all tho≈øe who know me, know that my naturall di≈øpo≈øition is to decline from ≈øeverity, much more from cruelty.</p>
               <p>That I have no particular provocations from their per≈øons, and have particular Obligations to their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling again≈øt whom I am to ≈øpeak.</p>
               <p>And though not ≈øo much, yet far more then I have, ≈øo I hope it will be believed, that only publick intere≈øt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:156910:214"/>have extorted this from me, and that which I would not ≈øay, if I conceived it not ≈øo true, and ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary that no undige≈øted meat can lie havier upon the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, then this un≈øaid would have lain upon my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the con≈øtitution of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth hath E≈øtabli≈øhed, or rather endeavored to E≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh to us the ≈øecurity of our goods, and the ≈øecurity of tho≈øe Laws which would ≈øecure us and our goods, by appointing for us Judges ≈øo ≈øettled, ≈øo ≈øworn, that there can be no oppre≈ø≈øion, but they of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt be acce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary; ≈øince if they neither deny, nor delay us Ju≈øtice, which neither for the great nor little ≈øeale, they ought to doe; the greate≈øt Per≈øon in this Kingdome cannot continue the lea≈øt violence upon the meane≈øt; But this ≈øecurity, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> hath been almo≈øt our ruine, for it hath been turned, or rather turned it ≈øelf into a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery again≈øt us: And tho≈øe per≈øons who ≈øhould have been as Dogs to defend the Sheep, have been as Wolves, to worry them.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Judges, M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> to in≈øtance not them onely, but their greate≈øt crime, have delivered an opinion, and judgement in an extrajudiciall manner, that is, ≈øuch as came not within their cognizance, they being Judges, and neither Philo≈øophers, nor Politicians; In which when that is ≈øo ab≈øolute and evident, the law of the land cea≈øes, and of generall rea≈øon and equity, by which particular laws at fir≈øt were framed, returnes to his throne and government, where <hi>≈øalus populi</hi> becomes not only <hi>≈øuprema,</hi> but <hi>≈øola lex;</hi> at which, and to which end, what≈øoever ≈øhould di≈øpence with the King, to make u≈øe of any mony, di≈øpences with us, to make u≈øe of his, and one anothers. In this judgement they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted both many and learned Acts and Declarations of Parliaments; and tho≈øe in this very ca≈øe, in this very reign, ≈øo that for them they needed to have con≈øulted
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:156910:215"/>with no other record, but with their memories.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They have contradicted apparent evidences by, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing mighty and eminent dangers, in the mo≈øt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, quiet, and halcian dayes that could po≈ø≈øibly be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, a few conceptible pirats, being our mo≈øt formidall enemies, and there being neither Prince nor State, with whom we had either Alyance, or Amity, or both.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They contradict the writ it ≈øelfe, by ≈øuppo≈øing that ≈øuppo≈øed danger to be ≈øo ≈øuddaine, that it would not ≈øtay for a Parliament, which required but forty daies. ≈øtay, and the writ being in no ≈øuch ha≈øte, but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ≈øtay ≈øeventimes over.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it ≈øeemed generally ≈øtrange, that they ≈øaw not the Law which all men el≈øe ≈øaw, but them≈øelves. Yet though this begot the more generall wonder, three other particulars begot the more generall indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt of all the rea≈øons for this judgement, was ≈øuch that they needed not any from the adver≈øe party to help them to convert tho≈øe few, who before the la≈øt ≈øu≈øpition of the legallity of that mo≈øt illegall writ, there being fewer that approved of the judgement, then there were that judged it, for I am confident they did not that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when they had allowed to the King, the ≈øole power in nece≈ø≈øity, the ≈øole judgement of nece≈ø≈øity, and by that enabled him to take both from us, what he would, when he would, and how he would, they yet continued to per≈øwade us that they had left us our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and proprieties.</p>
               <p>The third and la≈øt is, and which I confe≈ø≈øe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mo≈øt, That by the transformation of us from the ≈øtate of free ≈øubjects (a good phra≈øe Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> under Doctor <hi>Heylens</hi> favor) unto that of Villeins, they di≈øable us by Legall and voluntary ≈øupplies to expre≈ø≈øe our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:156910:215"/>to his Maje≈øty, and by that to cheri≈øh his to us, that is by Parliaments.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the cau≈øe of all the mi≈øeries we have ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the cau≈øe of all our jealou≈øies we have had, that we ≈øhould yet ≈øuffer; is, That a mo≈øt excellent Prince hath been mo≈øt infinitely abu≈øed by his Judges, telling him that by policy he might doe what he plea≈øed; with the fir≈øt of the≈øe we are now to deale, which may be a leading to the re≈øt. And ≈øince in proving of the≈øe Laws, upon which the≈øe men have trampled, our Ance≈øtours have ≈øhewed their urmo≈øt care and wi≈ødome, for our unaffected ≈øecurity, words having done nothing, and yet have done all their words can doe, we mu≈øt now be forced to think of aboli≈øhing of our grievances, &amp; of taking away this judgement, and the≈øe Judges together, and of regulating their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors by their examplary puni≈øhment.</p>
               <p>I will not ≈øpeak much; I will only ≈øay we have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed a great Per≈øon of high Trea≈øon, for intending to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our fundamentall Laws, and to introduce arbitrary Government, which we ≈øuppo≈øe he meant to doe, we are ≈øure the≈øe have done it, there being no Law more fundamentall, than that they have already ≈øubverted, and no government more ab≈øolute, than they have really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced: Mr. <hi>Speaker;</hi> not only the ≈øevere puni≈øhment, but the ≈øuddaine removall of the≈øe men, will have a ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain effect in one very con≈øiderable con≈øideration.</p>
               <p>We only accu≈øe, and the Hou≈øe of Lords condemn; In which condemnation they u≈øually receive advi≈øe (though not direction) from the Judges, And I leave it to every man to imagine how prejudiciall to us, that is, to the Common wealth, and how partiall to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low malefactors, the advice of ≈øuch judges is like to be. How undoubtedly for their own ≈øakes, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their power, that every action be judged to be a le≈ø≈øe fault, and every per≈øon to be le≈ø≈øe faulty, then in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:156910:216"/>Ju≈øtice they ought to doe; Among≈øt the≈øe, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Speaker, there is one that I mu≈øt not lo≈øe in the crowd, whom I doubt not but we ≈øhall finde when we examine the re≈øt of them, with what hopes they have been tempted: by what fears they have been a≈ø≈øaid, and by what, and by who≈øe importunity they have been pur≈øued, before they con≈øented to what they did; I doubt not I ≈øay, but wee ≈øhall then finde him to have been a mo≈øt admirable ≈øoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, but a mo≈øt abominable Judge; hee it is who not only gave away with his breath, what our Ance≈øtors had purcha≈øed for us by ≈øo large an expence of their time, their care, their trea≈øure, and their blood, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their indu≈øtry, as great as his inju≈øtice, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade others to joyne with him in that deed of gift, but ≈øtrove to root up tho≈øe liberties which they had cut downe; and to make our grievances immortall, and our ≈ølavery irreparable, le≈øt any part of our po≈øterity might want occa≈øion to cur≈øe him; He declared that power to be ≈øo inherent to the Crowne, as that it was not in the power even of Parliaments to divide them.</p>
               <p>I have heard, Mr. Speaker, and I thinke here that common Fame is ground enough for this Hou≈øe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe upon; And then undoubtedly enough to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed upon in this Hou≈øe: She hath reported this ≈øo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that I expect not that you ≈øhould bid me name him whom you all know, nor doe I looke to tell you newes, when I tell you it is my Lord Keeper. But this I think ≈øit to put you in minde, That his place admits him to his Maje≈øtie, and tru≈øts him with his Maje≈øties con≈øcience, and how pernicious every moment, whil≈øt one gives him means to infu≈øe ≈øuch unju≈øt opinions of this Hou≈øe, as are expre≈øt in a Libell, rather then a Declaration, of which many believe him to be the principall Secretary, and th' other puts the va≈øte and mo≈øt unlimited power of the Chauncery into his hands, the ≈øafe≈øt of which will be dangerous; for my part, I thinke no man ≈øecure, that he ≈øhall thinke him≈øelfe worth any thing when he ri≈øes,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:156910:216"/>whil≈øt all our e≈øtates are in his brea≈øt, who hath ≈øacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Countrey to his ambition, whil≈øt hee who hath pro≈øtracted his owne con≈øcience, hath the keeping of the Kings, and he who hath undone us already by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øale, hath a power left in him by retaile.</p>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, in the beginning of the Parliament he told us, and I am confident, every man here believes it before he told it, and never the more for his telling, though a ≈øorry witne≈ø≈øe is a good te≈øtimony again≈øt him≈øelfe; That his Maje≈øtie never required any thing from any his Mini≈øters but Ju≈øtice, and Integrity. Again≈øt which, if any of them have tran≈øgre≈øt, upon their heads, and that de≈øervedly, it ought to fall; It was full and truly; but he hath in this ≈øaying pronounced his owne condemnation; we ≈øhall be more partiall to him then he is to him≈øelf, if we be ≈ølow to pur≈øue it. It is therefore my ju≈øt and humble motion, That wee may chu≈øe a ≈øelect Committee to draw up his and their charge, and to examine their carriage in this particular, to make u≈øe of it in the charge, and if he ≈øhall be found guilty of tampering with Judges again≈øt the publike ≈øecurity, who thought tampering with witne≈ø≈øes in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate cau≈øe, worthy of ≈øo great a Fine, if he ≈øhall be found to have gone before the re≈øt to this Judgement, and to have gone beyond the re≈øt in this Judgement, that in the puni≈øhment for it, the Ju≈øtice of this Hou≈øe may not denie him the due honor both to preceed and exceed the re≈øt.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I ≈øtand not up with a Petition in my hand. I have it in my mouth, and have it in charge from them that ≈øent me hither, humbly to pre≈øent to the con≈øideration of this Hou≈øe the grievances of the County of <hi>Kent;</hi> I ≈øhall only ≈øumme them up; they are the≈øe,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, the great increa≈øe of Papi≈øts by the remi≈ø≈øe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of tho≈øe lawes which were made to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe them: the life of the law is execution; without this, they become a dead letter; this is wanting, and a great grievance.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond, is the obtruding and countenancing of divers new Ceremonies in matters of Religion, as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Communion Table Altar-wi≈øe, and bowing or cringing to, or towards it, the refu≈øing of the holy Sacrament to ≈øuch as refu≈øe to come to the Rayles, The≈øe carry with them ≈øome ≈øcandall, and much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>The third, is Military charges, and therein fir≈øt, that of Coate and Conduct money, required as a loane, pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed as a due, in each re≈øpect equally a grievance. The ≈øecond is the enhancing the price of Powder, whereby the Trayned Bands are much di≈øcouraged in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øing: how≈øoever this may appeare <hi>prima facie,</hi> upon
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:156910:217"/>due examination it will appeare a great grievance. The third is more particular to our County: It is this; The la≈øt Summer was twelvemonth, 1000. of our be≈øt Arms were taken from the owners, and ≈øent into <hi>Scotland:</hi> The compul≈øary way was this; If you will not ≈øend your Arms you ≈øhall goe your ≈øelves. M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the trayned Band is a <hi>Militia</hi> of great ≈øtrength and honor, without charges to the King, and de≈øerves all due encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The fourth, is the Canons, I a≈ø≈øigne the≈øe to bee a grievance; Fir≈øt, in re≈øpect of the matter, be≈øides the &amp;c. Oath. Secondly, in re≈øpect of the makers, they were cho≈øen to ≈øerve in a Convocation; that falling with the Parliament, the Scene was altered; The ≈øame men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new election, ≈øhufled into a ≈øacred Synod, Thirdly, in re≈øpect of the con≈øequence, which in this age, when the ≈øecond ill pre≈øident becomes a Law, is full of danger. The Clergy, without confirmation of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have a≈ø≈øumed unto them≈øelves power to make Lawes, to grant Reliefe by the name of benevolence, and to intermeddle with our free-hold by ≈øu≈øpen≈øions and deprivation, This is a grievance of a high nature.</p>
               <p>The next grievance is the Ship-money; This cries aloud, I may ≈øay, I hope without offence, This ≈øtrikes the fir≈øt born of every family, I meane our inheritance; If the Lawes give the king power, in any danger of the kingdom, whereof hee is Judge, to impo≈øe what and when hee plea≈øe; wee owe all that is left, to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the King, not to the Law, M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> this makes the Farmors faint, and the Plough to goe heavy.</p>
               <p>The next is the great decay of cloathing and fall of our woolls; The≈øe are the golden Mines of <hi>England</hi> which gives a foundation to that trade which we drive with all the World; I know there are many ≈øtarres concurre in this con≈øtellation, I will not trouble you with more than one cau≈øe of it, which I dare affirme to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:156910:218"/>be the greate≈øt. It is the great cu≈øtomes and impo≈øitions laid upon our Cloath, and new Draperies: I ≈øpeak not this with a wi≈øh to le≈ø≈øen the King revenews, ≈øo it be done by Parliament; I ≈øhall give my voice to lay more charge upon the ≈øuperfluities, due regard being had to trade, which we import from all other Nations: ≈øure I am that tho≈øe impo≈øitions upon our native commodities are dangerous, give liberty to our neighbours to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell; And I take it for a rule, that be≈øides our lo≈ø≈øe in trade, which is five times as much as the King receiveth, what is impo≈øed upon our Cloaths, this it taken from the rent of our lands. I have but one grievance more to offer unto you: But this one compri≈øeth many, It is a nea≈øt of wa≈øpes, or ≈øwarm of vermine, which have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crept the land, I mean the Monopoles and Polers of the people; The≈øe like the Frogs of Aegypt have gotten po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of our dwellings, and have ≈øcarce a room free from them: They ≈øup in our Cup, they dip in our Di≈øh, they ≈øit by our fire, we finde them in the Dy fat, wa≈øh-boule, and Poudering tub, they ≈øhare with the Butler in his box, they have marked and ≈øealed us from head to foot. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they will not bate us a Pin: we may not buy our own Cloathes without their brokage; The≈øe are the Leeches that have ≈øuckt the Common wealth ≈øo hard, that it is almo≈øt become hecticall: And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> ≈øome of the≈øe are a≈øhamed of their right names; they have a vizard to hide the brand made by that good law in the la≈øt Parliament of King <hi>James;</hi> They ≈øhelter them≈øelves under the name of a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they make by-laws which ≈øerve their turns to ≈øquee≈øe us, and fill their pur≈øes; unface the≈øe and they will prove as bad Cards as any in the pack; The≈øe are not petty Chapmen, but whole≈øale men. Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have ecchoed to you the cryes of the kingdome, I will tell you their hopes: they look to Heaven for a ble≈ø≈øing upon this Parliament, they hang upon his Maje≈øties
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:156910:218"/>exemplary piety and great ju≈øtice, which renders his eares open to the ju≈øt complaints of his Subjects; we have had lately a gratious a≈ø≈øurance of it, they are the wi≈øe conduct of this, whereby the other great affaires of the Kingdome, and this our grievance of no le≈ø≈øe import; And this may go hand in hand, in preparation and re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; Then by the ble≈ø≈øing of God we ≈øhall return home with an Olive branch in our mouths, and full confirmations of the priviledges, which we received from our Ance≈øtors, and ow to our po≈øterity, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very freeborn Engli≈øh man hath received with the aire he breathed in.</p>

               <p>I Had rather Act then ≈øpeak in tho≈øe weighty bu≈øine≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of the Kingdome, which have been ≈øo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by the≈øe foure worthy Gentlemen, that ≈øpake la≈øt, and therefore I ≈øhall be ≈øhort. For when I look upon the Body of this goodly and flouri≈øhing Kingdom in matters of Religion, and of our laws, (For like <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> Twins, they live and dye together) I ≈øay when I behold the≈øe in that ≈øtate and plight, as they have been repre≈øented to us, <hi>Flere magis libet quam dicere;</hi> But this is our comfort, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that we are all met together for the welfare and happine≈ø≈øe of Prince and People; And who knows whether this may not be the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:156910:219"/>time, wherein God will re≈øtore our Religion as at the fir≈øt, and our laws as at the beginning.</p>
               <p>The honour of a King con≈øi≈øteth in the weale of his people: this undoubted maxime his Maje≈øty hath made good by his late gracious ≈øpeech and promi≈øe to us to redre≈ø≈øe all our grievances, to de≈øtroy the enemies of our Peace, and plenty.</p>
               <p>To make a people rich, they mu≈øt have ea≈øe &amp; ju≈øtice. Ea≈øe in their Con≈øciences from the bane of Super≈øtition, from the intolerable burthen of innovation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and from the racks and tortures of ≈øtrange and new fangled Oaths. They mu≈øt be ea≈øed in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, being <hi>liberi homines,</hi> and not <hi>Vilanes;</hi> All illegall arre≈øts and impri≈øonment again≈øt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> being our greate≈øt liberties. They mu≈øt be ea≈øed in their lands from Forre≈øt, where never any Deer fed, from depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, where never any Farm was decayed, and from inclo≈øures, where never any hedges were ≈øet. But mu≈øt la≈øtly be ea≈øed in their goods from their exactions and expilations of Pur≈øevants and Apparitors, of Projectors and Monopoli≈øts, <hi>Humanarum Calamitatum mercatores,</hi> as an ancient finely calls them: and if the people have all the≈øe ea≈øements, yet if they have not Ju≈øtice, they cannot ≈øub≈øi≈øt; ju≈øtice is to the Civill body, as food to the naturall; If the ≈øtreams of Ju≈øtice be by unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe turned into Gall and Wormword, or by cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like the Aegyptian waters, be turned into blood, tho≈øe which drink of the≈øe brooks mu≈øt needs dy and peri≈øh.</p>
               <p>The Law ≈øaith that all Ju≈øtice is in the King, who is ≈øtiled in our book <hi>Fons Ju≈øtitiae,</hi> and he commits it to his Judges, for the execution wherein he tru≈øts them with two of the chiefe≈øt flowers, which belong to his crown: The admini≈øtration of his ju≈øtice, and the expo≈øition of his laws: but he will not tru≈øt them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Oath required of them, by the Statute of 18 <hi>E.</hi> 31. Which is ≈øo ≈øtrict and ≈øevere, that it made a Judge
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:156910:219"/>whom I know, though hone≈øt and ≈øtrict, yet to quake and tremble at the very mention of it. The effect of the Oath is, that they ≈øhould doe equall law, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right to all the Kings Subjects, poore a≈øwell as rich, without regard of any per≈øon.</p>
               <p>That they ≈øhould not deny to doe common right to any man by the Kings letters; and for any other cau≈øe: And in ca≈øe ≈øuch letters do, that they proceed to do come the law notwith≈øtanding ≈øuch letters, or for any other cau≈øes, as they will an≈øwer to the King, in bodies, goods, and lands: how this Oath hath been performed, we have ≈øeen and felt; I need ≈øay no more. But when I ca≈øt mine eyes upon the inferiour Courts of Ju≈øtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no ≈øuch oath is required; I meane, the High Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and other Eccle≈øia≈øticall Courts, my ≈øoule hath bled for the wrong pre≈ø≈øures which I have ob≈øerved to have been done and committed in the≈øe Courts, again≈øt the Kings good people; e≈øpecially for the mo≈øt mon≈øtrous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øe of the Oath <hi>Ex Officio;</hi> which, as it is now u≈øed, I can call no other than <hi>Carnificina Con≈øcientiae:</hi> I have ≈øome rea≈øon to know this, that have been an Attendant to the Court the≈øe five yeeres for my ≈øelfe, and a deare friend of mine, ≈øometimes Knight of our Shire, for a meer triviall bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; that the mo≈øt that could be proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, was the putting on his hat in the time of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.

And we do not the Spani≈øh King, our greate≈øt enemy, a greater favour than by his, who being Lord of the≈øe commodities by his We≈øt-Indies, we ≈øhall ≈øo advance them to our impoveri≈øhment, for it is not in the power of any State to rai≈øe of the price of their own, but the value that their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ≈øet upon them, experience hath taught us that the enfoeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Coyn is but a ≈øhift for a while, as drinke to one in a drop≈øie, to make him ≈øwell the more, but the ≈øtate was never thorowly cured, as we ≈øaw in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, and the late Queens, untill the Coyn was made rich again.</p>
               <p>I cannot but then conclude my honorable Lords, that if the proportion of Gold and Silver to each other be wrought to that purity, by the advice of the Arti≈øts that neither may be too rich for the other, that the Mintage may be reduced to ≈øome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neighbour parts, and that the i≈ø≈øue of native commodities may be brought to over-ballance the entrance of the forraigne, we need not ≈øeek any ≈øhift, but ≈øhall again ≈øee our trade to flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh, the Mint as, the pul≈øe of the Common-wealth, again to bear, and our Materialls by Indu≈øtry, to be Mynes of Gold and Silver, which we all wi≈øh and work for, ≈øupported unto us, and the honor of Ju≈øtice, and Profit of his Maie≈øty.</p>

                  <head>Certain general Rules collected concerning Money and Bullion, out of the late Con≈øultation at Court.</head>
                  <p>GOld and ≈øilver hath a two fold e≈øtimation in the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øique, as they are moneys, and Princes mea≈øures given to his people, and this is a Prerogative of Kings in the <hi>Intrin≈øique,</hi> they are commodities valewing each other according to the plenty or ≈øcarcity; and ≈øo all other commodities by them, and that is the ≈øole power of Trade.</p>
                  <p>The mea≈øure in a Kingdome ought to be con≈øtant, It is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and honor of the King; for if they be altered, all men at that time are deceived in the precedent contracts, either for lands or moneys, and the King mo≈øt of all; for no man knoweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he hath, or what he oweth.</p>
                  <p>This made the Lord Trea≈øurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> in Anno 1573. when ≈øome Projectors had ≈øet on foot a matter of that nature, to tell them that they were worthy to ≈øuffer death, for attempting to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:156910:225"/>put ≈øo great a di≈øhonor upon the Queen, and detriment and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content on the people; for to alter this publike mea≈øure is to leave all the Markets of the Kingdome unfurni≈øhed: and what will be the mi≈øchiefe the Proclamation of 5. and 6. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Mary,</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> will manife≈øt, when but a rumor produced that effect ≈øo farre, that be≈øides the faith of the Princes to the contrary delivered in their Edicts, they were inforced to cau≈øe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates in every Shire re≈øpectively, to con≈øtrain the people to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Market, to prevent a mutiny.</p>
                  <p>To thinke then this mea≈øure at this time ≈øhort, is to rai≈øe all prices, or to turn the mea≈øure or money now current into di≈øu≈øe and Bullion; for who will depart with any, when it is by ≈øeven more in the hundred in the ma≈ø≈øe, then the now moneys, and yet of no more value in the Market.</p>
                  <p>Hence the nece≈ø≈øitie of it will follow, that there will not of a long time be Minted of the new to drive the exchange of the Kingdome, and ≈øo all trade at one in≈øtance at a ≈øtand; and in meane time the Markets unfurni≈øhed, and thus far as money is a mea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>Now as it is a commoditie, it is re≈øpected and valued, by the intrin≈øique qualitie, and fir≈øt the one mettall to the other.</p>
                  <p>All commodities are priced by plenty or ≈øcarcity, by deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe or cheapne≈ø≈øe, the one to the other. If then we de≈øire our ≈øilver to buy gold as it hath lately been, we mu≈øt let it it be the cheaper and le≈ø≈øe in proportion valued, and ≈øo contrary for one equivalent proportion in both, will bring in neither; we ≈øee the profit there of the unu≈øuall quantitie of gold brought late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Mint by rea≈øon of the price, we rate it at above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, and gold may be bought too dear; to furni≈øh then this way the Mint with both, is impo≈ø≈øible.</p>
                  <p>And at this time it was apparantly proved both by the be≈øt Arti≈øts, and marchants mo≈øt acquainted with the Exchange, in both the examples of the Mint-ma≈øters, in the Rix-dolor, and Royall of Eight, that ≈øilver here is of equall valew, and gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove with forreine parts in the intrin≈øique, but that the fallacie pre≈øented to the Lords by the Mint-ma≈øters, is only in the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of extrin≈øique qualitie.</p>
                  <p>But if we de≈øire both it is not the ray≈øing the valew that doth it, but the balancing the Trade, for we buy more then we ≈øell of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:156910:226"/>all other commodities, be the money never ≈øo high priced, we mu≈øt part with it to make the di≈øproportion even, if we ≈øell more then the contrary will follow.</p>
                  <p>And this is plain in Spani≈øh nece≈ø≈øities, for ≈øhould that King advance to a double his Royall of Eight, yet needing it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the barrenne≈ø≈øe of his Country, more of forreign wares, then can countervaile by exchange with his wares, he mu≈øt then part with his money, and gain the more by enhaun≈øing his coyn, but he payeth a higher price for the commodities he buyeth, if this work of ray≈øing be his own.</p>
                  <p>But if we ≈øhall make improvement of gold and ≈øilver being the Staple-commodities of this Kingdome, we then advancing the the price of his aba≈øe to him our own commodities.</p>
                  <p>To ≈øhape this kingdome to the fa≈øhion of the Netherlands, were to frame a Royall Monarchie by a ≈øociety of Marchants, their Country is a continuall Faire, and ≈øo price of moneys mu≈øt ri≈øe and fall to fit their occa≈øions; we ≈øee this by rai≈øing the Exchange of <hi>Franckford,</hi> and other places, of their u≈øuall time of the Marts.</p>
                  <p>This frequent and daily change in the Low-Countries of their moneys is no ≈øuch inju≈øtice to any there, as it would be here, for there they being all Merchants, or mechanicks, they can rate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly their labour and their Ware, whether it be Coyne, or other merchandize, to the pre≈øent condition of their own money in Exchange.</p>
                  <p>And our Engli≈øh Merchants to who≈øe profe≈ø≈øion it properly belongeth, do ≈øo according to their ju≈øt intrin≈øique valew of their forreign Coyn in all barter of commodities or Exchange, except u≈øance which we that are rated and tyed by the extrin≈øiques mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of moneys in all our con≈øtant reckonigs, and annuall bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains at home cannot do.</p>
                  <p>And for us then to rai≈øe our Coyn at this time, to equall their proportions were but to render our ≈øelves to a perpetuall incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, for they will rai≈øe upon us daily them again, which we of cour≈øe ≈øhall follow, el≈øe receive no profit by this pre≈øent change; and ≈øo de≈øtroy the Policie, Ju≈øtice, honor, and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our State for ever.</p>

               <p>For the other ≈øu≈øpition of my being a favourer or an advancer of Popery, I prote≈øt before the Almighty God,

               <p>For that which hath pa≈ø≈øed my hands for favor of that party, it hath been meerly mini≈øteriall, as his Maje≈øty be≈øt knows, and I mu≈øt be bold to ≈øay that his Maje≈øty hath not been deceived by it, but hath received many greater advantages; be≈øides that, if a Secretary of State ≈øhould not hold intelligence with the party, is ab≈øolute to di≈øable him for the ≈øervice of the State, and that hath been done alwaies more or le≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo mu≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies continue, Kings and their Mini≈øters of State, have ever had, and might ever have a Latitude according to time and occa≈øion, and cannot be ≈øo tied according to ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe of law as others are, without perill to the government, therefore when the Roman party were practique and bu≈øie about the State, there was rea≈øon to be more ≈øtrict, but now by the wi≈øedome of the Queen and her good Officers, they are better tempered, le≈ø≈øe ≈øeverity hath been u≈øed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prerogative of the Prince to u≈øe moderation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to accu≈øation: further than this I have not had to doe with the Roman party, nor thus far but in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to my Ma≈øters commandement, which I hope ≈øhall not be cen≈øured a crime, this being my condition; I mo≈øt

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> God forbid we ≈øhould be cruell or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative to any; but let us take heed we be not ≈øo to our ≈øelves, and them the ≈øent us; if we doe not mend our pace, and ≈øo run as we may obtaine.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I hope we ≈øhall make good the work we have undertaken, and win that prize and goale we aime at; el≈øe if we faile in this our pur≈øuit of ju≈øtice, it is time to look about us: for then I feare that we our ≈øelves ≈øhall hardly ≈øcape ≈øcot-free.

The Court of the Pre≈øidents, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the North, or as it is more u≈øually called, the Courts of York, which by the ≈øpirit and ambition of the Mini≈øters, tru≈øted there, or by the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Courts to enlarge their own power and juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, hath ≈øo prodigiou≈øly broken down the bankes of the fir≈øt Councell, in which it ran, hath almo≈øt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed that Countrey under the Sea of Arbitrary power, and involved the people in a Labyrinth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtemper, oppre≈ø≈øion and poverty.</p>
               <p>Your Lord≈øhips will give me leave not with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption to informe your great under≈øtandings, but that you may know what moved the Hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to their re≈øolutions to remember your Lord≈øhips of the foundation, and erecting this Court, and of the progre≈ø≈øe and growth of it.</p>
               <p>Your Lord≈øhips well know, that upon the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all religious hou≈øes to ≈øuch a value in the 27. yeere of <hi>H.</hi> 8. from that time to the thirtieth yeare of that Kings raigne, many (not fewer than ≈øix In≈øurrections)

               <p>Secondly, they re≈øtrain him from preaching ≈øome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as of prede≈øtination and others that overthrow Arminian tenets, when his faithfulne≈ø≈øe in his Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires he ≈øhould keep nothing back,<note place="margin">This is read to the Presbyter upon his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his charge then given him is remarkable See the booke of ordering Prie≈øts.</note> but to ≈øhew them all the coun≈øell of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.27. Thirdly, they will not ≈øuffer him to intermeddle in the di≈øcipline. The≈øe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpations I conceive are to be taken away, and the Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to be left free from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Epi≈øcopacy, I conceive, that fir≈øt their Baronies and the intermedling of the Clergy in Civill Councels, affaires, and imployments, ought to be taken from them.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, I conceive ≈øuch Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and intermedling is again≈øt the Law of God, Chri≈øt refu≈øed to intermeddle in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inheritances (though more able and fit for it then any Bi≈øhop) <hi>Luke</hi> 12.13. and ≈øaith his Kingdome is not of the world, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. and the Di≈øciple is not above his Ma≈øter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24. and <hi>Acts</hi> 6. The Apo≈øtles refu≈øe to intermeddle in the Deacon or Churchwardens office, though of all earthly imployments the neere≈øt to the Church; and the rea≈øon they give is remarkable for this purpo≈øe, becau≈øe they were to attend to Prayer and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of the word, and therefore not meet for them to attend ≈øuch ≈øecular matters, and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. The Apo≈øtles laies down a rule in this ca≈øe, that <hi>nemo militans Deo ≈øe implicat negotiis hujus ≈øeculi,</hi> and upon this ground, even the Popes Canon-laws are again≈øt the≈øe things, as incon≈øi≈øtent with the mini≈øteriall function.

               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:156910:253"/>
               <p>Secondly, it is again≈øt the fundamentall Laws of this Land, whereby they that are within holy Orders,<note place="margin">Non e≈øt con≈øonum quod ille qui ≈øalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri ≈øtatui anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; piis operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus continue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervit ad in≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in ≈øecularibus neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King may command the ≈øervice of men in orders, and then it is to be given him by naturall allegiance.</p>
               <p>This rule admits two exceptions and both are in this ca≈øe: fir≈øt, except the ≈øervice from that per≈øon be again≈øt the Law of God as here it is, and then it is better obey God then man, <hi>in prae≈øentia majoris ce≈ø≈øat pote≈øtas minoris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the ≈øervice concern the Common-wealth, and the per≈øon of whom it is required, be not ≈øufficient for it, nor brought up unto it, the command is again≈øt Law, and the ≈øervice not to be done, if the King grant the Office of the Clarke of the Crown to one not brought up to it, it is void, and the ≈øervice not to be intermedled withall by him, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.56. <hi>Winters</hi> ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that part of the Bi≈øhops ≈øpirituall office by which he claimeth ≈øuperiority over Presbyters ought to be taken as I conceive from them as being again≈øt the will of God.</p>
               <p>The Apo≈øtles que≈øtioning among them≈øelves which ≈øhould be the Superior, are ≈øharply reproved by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for it, and he tels them plainly it ≈øhall not be ≈øo among them, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. and <hi>Diotrophes,</hi> 3 <hi>Job.</hi> 9. is branded for it, that he ≈øought prehominence in the Church. The my≈øtery of iniquity in the Popi≈øh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, in the Presbyters exalting them≈øelves, began to work in the pure≈øt primitive times, (as we ≈øee in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophes,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> cavear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.) and never left till it came to the Pope,<note place="margin">2 The≈ø. 2.4.7.</note> the highe≈øt degree and top thereof; By which it ≈øeems to me evident, that to leave the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Church government ≈øet down in the word of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:156910:254"/>God to follow the examples of after ages upon a fal≈øe cry of primitive times, is to for≈øake the pure fountain, and wallow in the muddy and corrupted ≈øtreams of antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian ambition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that part of the ≈øpirituall office of the Bi≈øhop whereby he is to in≈øtruct the people committed to his charge, with the holy Scriptures, as upon the 2 que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put unto him at his Con≈øecration, he undertakes to doe, ought (as I conceive) to be reduced to a po≈ø≈øibility for him to performe it. It is impo≈ø≈øible for him to doe it to a whole Dioce≈ø≈øe, therefore he ≈øhould be limited to ≈øome particular Congregation, unto which he might perform this tru≈øt, which requires ≈øufficiency, attendance and diligence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Ordination in the ≈øcriptures is ever expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to be by them in the Church, that had authority and were officers in the Church, as Apo≈øtles, Evangeli≈øts and after by the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. And a ≈øhadow of this remains in our Law,<note place="margin">Acts 14.23. Titus 1.5, 6, 7.</note> for the Bi≈øhop only is not to lay hands upon the party to be ordained, but the Presbyters there attending are to joyn with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop therein.<note place="margin">Books of orde ring Prie≈øts.</note> This I conceive is not fit to be in the hands of any one ordinary officer in the Church, the di≈øcerning of the gifts, abilities and faithfulne≈ø≈øe of per≈øons to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyters, requiring great judgement, care, and circum≈øpection. <hi>Plus vident oculi quam oculus.</hi> The like I ≈øay of deprivation.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Excommunication by the Scriptures ought to be only in ca≈øe of enormous offences and ob≈øtinacy in them, and onely in the Congregation whereof the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Excommunicate is a member, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. Tell the Church cannot be meant of one man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Diotro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> is branded for taking upon him alone to ca≈øt any out of the Church. This al≈øo abu≈øed as well as u≈øurped by the Bi≈øhop is to be reformed.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, In≈øtitution and induction are u≈øurped by the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:156910:254"/>Bi≈øhops upon the fundamentall Laws of this Kingdome, by which the Patron after his Clerk was ordained, did without any more inve≈øt him into the Church. See <hi>Selden</hi> of tithes 86. And a relick of this we retain ≈øtill in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that be donatives.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The juri≈ødiction of tithes, cau≈øes matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and cau≈øes te≈øtamentary in the times of the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing power of the Pope, when the Bi≈øhops thereby grew more formidable, were taken from the Civill Magi≈øtrate to whom originally they belonged, upon pretence, that the tithes were <hi>Jure divino,</hi> the Churches patrimony and Mariage a Sacrament, and that the di≈øpo≈øing the goods of the dead, mo≈øt properly belonged to him for the good of the ≈øoule in Purgatory to redeem it thence, to whom the cure of the Soule appertained in his life time, <hi>vide</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>Te≈øtaments</hi> 4.11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.12 <hi>B.

               <p>Eighthly, The matters which are meerly and only ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, (which are properly of Eccle≈øia≈øticall cognizance) were anciently by the Lawyers of this Kingdome, heard and determined in the County and hundred Courts by the Sheriffe and the Bi≈øhop, and by <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the≈øe matters were taken thence and appropriated to the Bi≈øhop alone, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Rotul.</hi> Parliament, num. 12. <hi>Selden</hi> of tithes 412. Book of Martyrs, 154.</p>
               <p>And by the Law of God (as I conceive) they ought to be heard &amp; determined by them that have rule in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregations and Churches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. which if it were ≈øo among us would be a wonderfull ea≈øe, and ≈øave great charges to the ≈øubject.</p>
               <p>And where the difficulty of ca≈øe or greatne≈ø≈øe of the per≈øons whom it may concern, or where the Governors in particular Congregations demean not them≈øelves as they ought, it ought to be referred to a Synod of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ≈øo many as ≈øhall be thought meet, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15. a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:156910:255"/>que≈øtion of difficulty ari≈øing in the particular Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the di≈ø≈øention growing great about the ≈øame, they ≈øent to <hi>Hieru≈øalem,</hi> and there the Apo≈øtles and Presbyters convened, debated, concluded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the matter, and impo≈øed the ob≈øervation thereof upon <hi>Antioch</hi> and other Churches, ver. 1.2.6.28. The Apo≈øtles would not meddle in the que≈øtion without the Presbyters, and other Bi≈øhops there were none there, nor in the Churches.

               <p>And the change of our Laws (in ca≈øe this Hou≈øe ≈øhall ≈øee cau≈øe for it) will not be ≈øo great or difficult as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ≈øome.

And for the Bi≈øhops attendance on tryals of life, it is needle≈ø≈øe, he being no Judge in it, but the Court, who may appoint any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or doe it them≈øelves. And for Sacring of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and other dead things, it is fit to be neglected and left off, being a Popi≈øh vaine ≈øuper≈øtition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out colour of countenance from the word of God, the Leviticall con≈øecrations being typicall and ≈øhadows of the good things we enjoy under the Go≈øpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Bi≈øhop being thus reformed and reduced to a condition and ≈øtate agreeable to the word of God, the only right rule of reformation:</p>
               <p>The Deans, Chapters, Vicars Generall, Chancellors,<note place="margin">25 Exod. 9 40. 1 Chron. 28.11.19. Ezek. 4.10. 2 Cor. 4 6.</note> and the re≈øt of his Traine, <hi>qua tales</hi> (being <hi>tellaris inutile pondus</hi>) are to be removed and taken away al≈øo as ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and u≈øele≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>We have intru≈øted the Epi≈øcopacy the≈øe foure≈øcore and two years with the cure of Soules, a tru≈øt of the highe≈øt concernment, if we con≈øider the price of Souls. Our Saviour is at a ≈øtand in it, <hi>What ≈øhall a man give in recompence for his Soule?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> the price of it is be≈øt ≈øeen in the price given for it, God and man mu≈øt become a cur≈øe to redeem it.</p>
               <p>How have they di≈øcharged this tru≈øt? Survay the Churches throughout the Kingdome, and you ≈øhall finde neer eight parts of tenne of them filled with Idoll,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:156910:256"/>idle, or ≈øcandalous Mini≈øters, whom the Bi≈øhops might have by law refu≈øed, if di≈øcovered unto them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and ought to have removed being di≈øcovered unto them afterwards. And it hath aboundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared this Parliament upon examinations taken in this Hou≈øe of Commons and the Committees thereof; that when Mini≈øters extreamly ≈øcandalous, have been di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Bi≈øhops and their Officers, and in the High-commi≈ø≈øion Court, they have received no further cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure then admonition, or to be put to purgation, and ≈øo ≈øent home to de≈øtroy more Soules, as if they had not done ≈øufficiently in that way before.</p>
               <p>But if any godly, learned, and painfull Preacher hath been di≈øcovered by them, they have ≈øought out all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions again≈øt ≈øuch, to thru≈øt them out of the Church, and lay their Congregations wa≈øte and de≈øolate, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very trifle, though indifferent in their own account, hath been made u≈øe of, and ≈øufficed them for this, yea, they have made occa≈øions and traps to overthrow ≈øuch worthies without Law and again≈øt Law.</p>
               <p>And herein they have inherited the vertues of <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi> their fir≈øt Predece≈ø≈øor, who would not receive the brethren, and forbad them that would, and ca≈øt both out of the Church, 3 <hi>John</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And though ≈øome of the Bi≈øhops have been and are good men, yet look into their Dioce≈ø≈øe, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their gift, and judge whether they be good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops or no, you ≈øhall ≈øinde them as faulty concerning this great tru≈øt as any of the re≈øt. And whether it be not from hence evident, or at lea≈øt greatly to be ≈øu≈øpected, that ≈øome cur≈øe cleaves to the very Office of Bi≈øhops, when good men cannot manage it to any better purpo≈øe then the bad, let any man judge.</p>
               <p>This Spirituall Monarchy hath two incidents in≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable unto it, fir≈øt that it is alwayes incroaching and u≈øurping upon other powers, and ≈øwallowing them up,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:156910:256"/>as the <hi>≈øeries</hi> of all ages aboundantly manife≈øts. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is ever inclining and returning to Popery, and the Religion of Antichir≈øt, as hath mo≈øt cleerly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even in our daies as well as before ≈øince the re≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Religion; I ≈øhall for this time in≈øtance onely in three places of the Rubrick corrupted by Bi≈øhops: In the Rubrick confirmed by act of Parliament, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, It is directed, that prayer ≈øhall be in ≈øuch place of the Church or Chancell, and the Mini≈øter ≈øhall ≈øo turne him, as the people may be≈øt heare.</p>
               <p>In the Rubrick as it is now Printed, prayer ≈øhall be u≈øed in the accu≈øtomed place, &amp;c. except it ≈øhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe determined by the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Whereby they have introduced the Popi≈øh practice of reading Prayers at the upper end of the Chancell at their Altar, where few in the Church can ≈øee them, and fewer heare them, and turning their faces to the Ea≈øt, and their backs to the people in reading in the Desk, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour all with the determination of the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the Letany, there are the≈øe words in the book of Common prayer confirmed by the Statutes of 5. and 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> From the tyranny of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his dete≈øtable enormities, good Lord deliver us; and that the Bi≈øhops in the latter books have cau≈øed to be left out wholly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the Rubrick concerning the admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper, as it ≈øtands now altered, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent declaration of the rea≈øon why kneeling at this Sacrament was left in the reformation, and a renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tran≈øub≈øtantiation, Con≈øub≈øtantiation, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread and wine, as abhominable Idolatries, are wholly obliterate and left out, that the u≈øe of that ge≈øture there might be rendred the more ≈øu≈øpicious and ≈øuper≈øtitious, and a more clear way might be made, to induce the Popi≈øh ≈øuper≈øtitious innovations, that have been ≈øince obtruded upon us, concerning the Table,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:156910:257"/>Altar, ≈øupreminent pre≈øence of God almighty there, cringings, Altar-wor≈øhip and the like. And I conceive alterations were made by the Bi≈øhops, as appeares unto me by the Proclamation they procured to be ≈øet forth 5. <hi>Martii,</hi> 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> concerning the booke of Common prayer.</p>
               <p>And how can things pro≈øper better in the hands of the Epi≈øcopacy, when Gods ble≈ø≈øing alone giveth out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øperity, and the Lord di≈øpo≈øeth his ble≈ø≈øing in his owne way only, and not in any other?</p>
               <p>And this being no plant planted by God in his Church, how can it be expected it ≈øhould yeeld us any better fruits then we have received from it?</p>
               <p>Againe, (if I be not much deceived) the Epi≈øcopacy in what≈øoever it exceeds the Presbyters office (in which ≈øen≈øe only I ≈øpeak of it) is abranch of the Hierarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Antichri≈øt: and of that con≈øider what is prophe≈øied <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.11. They ≈øhall not have any re≈øt day nor night, that receive any print of the name of the Bea≈øt; and examine the former and pre≈øent times, whether the ≈øame hath not been verified among us, and in all ≈øuch places where that Hierarchy hath been entertained, whether the mo≈øt troubles and mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Churches, and in great part al≈øo of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, have not ≈øprung from the ≈øaid Epi≈øcopacy and the fruites thereof?</p>
               <p>Therefore let us proceed to the perfecting of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our Church, and to the gathering out of it every ≈øtone that offends, even what≈øoever is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, and the ≈øtandard of his word, and reduce every thing in the government to the rule, and walke in it in Gods way, which is the ≈øure way to have his pre≈øence with us, and ble≈ø≈øing upon us and ours for ever.</p>
               <p>It hath ever been a point of higher honour from God, and of greater acceptance and e≈øteem with him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

               <p>Secondly, that not only ≈øuch Rights and Liberties as the King and his Progenitors, but al≈øo that ≈øuch as God had endowed the Church of <hi>England</hi> with, which God him≈øelf hath given by his Law unto the univer≈øall <hi>Church,</hi> and in that which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by their <hi>Charter</hi> have bequeathed to the particular Church of <hi>England;</hi> and this we doubt not was the cau≈øe that moved <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ≈øo effectually and powerfully to bend him≈øelfe again≈øt the Popes Supremacy, u≈øurped at that time over the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for, ≈øaith the King, we will with hazard of life and lo≈ø≈øe of our Crown uphold and defend in our Realms what≈øoever we ≈øhall know to be the will of God.</p>

               <p>THis happie meeting, is to bemoane and redre≈ø≈øe the unhappie State of this Common-wealth. Let me have I be≈øeech you your leave, to give you in a word, a ≈øhort view of our griefes, then ≈øee whence they flow. Our Lawes, our liberties, our lives, and which is the life of all, our Religion; all which have been by the endeavours of ≈øo many Ages ≈øecured, and made ≈øo much our owne, can ≈øcarce be called ours. Our Lawes, the only finews and ligeaments of our e≈øtates, which ≈øhould run in an even ≈øtreame, are now made to di≈ødaine their bancks, and to overflow and drown their fields, which they ≈øhould gently redre≈ø≈øe our liberties, the very ≈øpirit and e≈ø≈øence of our weale, which ≈øhould differ us from ≈ølaves, and ≈øpeake us Engli≈øh-men; are held away by them, that even whiles they take them from us, cannot but confe≈ø≈øe they are our proper dues. Are not our lives in danger, when an enemy di≈øgui≈øed like a friend provoked, is as it were ≈øuffered (becau≈øe indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in vaine re≈øi≈øted) to come almo≈øt into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomes, to rifle ≈øome of their goods, others of their loyalty; which perhaps they could not, neither would have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might we with united force have re≈øi≈øted.

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:156910:263"/>which ≈øhould have beene our Cordiall in all our di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; like a forced Virgin laments ever, that her pure innocencie is taken from her; and ≈øure all the≈øe effects mu≈øt have their cau≈øes.</p>
               <p>That we have ju≈øt, and wi≈øe Lawes, we may thanke tho≈øe good Kings that made them; the ≈øettled expo≈øition of ju≈øt circum≈øcribed Lawes to binde and defend the Subject.

               <p>THe di≈øtempers of this Kingdome are well knowne, they need not repetition.

               <p>Fir≈øt, There is a de≈øigne to alter Law and Religion: the parties that effect this, are Papi≈øts, who are obliged by a maxime in their doctrine, that they are not onely bound to maintaine their Religion, but al≈øo to extirpate all others.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond is their Hierarchie which cannot amount to the height they ayme at, without a breach of our Law. To which their Religion nece≈ø≈øarily ioynes, that if the one ≈øtands, the other mu≈øt fall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Agents and Pen≈øioners to forraigne States, who ≈øee we cannot comply to them, if we maintaine our Religion e≈øtabli≈øhed, which is contrary to theirs, here they intend chiefly the Spani≈øh white gold works which are of mo≈øt effect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Favourites, ≈øuch as for promotion prize not con≈øcience, and ≈øuch are our Judges ≈øpirituall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; ≈øuch are al≈øo ≈øome of our Councellors of State.

               <p>Fir≈øt, The politicall interpretation of the Law to ≈øerve their turnes, and thus to impo≈øe taxes with a colour of Law; a Judge ≈øayd it when a <hi>babe is corpus</hi> was payd for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By keeping the King in continuall want, that he may ≈øeeke to their coun≈øells for r liefe; to this purpo≈øe, to keepe the Parliaments in di≈øta≈øte, that their coun≈øells may be taken. The King by them is brought to

               <p>Thirdly, Arbitrary proceedings in Courts of Ju≈øtice; we have all Law left to the con≈øcience of a ≈øingle man. All Courts are now Courts of con≈øcience, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Plotters to inforce a war between <hi>Scotland,</hi> and us; that when we had well wearied one another, we might be both brought to what ≈øcorn they plea≈øed; The pertition wall is only unity.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The ≈øuddaine di≈ø≈øolving of Parliaments, and puni≈øhing of Parliament men, all to affright us from ≈øpeaking what we thinke.

And Papi≈øts are under appearance to the King his be≈øt Subjects, for they contibute money to the War, which the Prote≈øtants will not do.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Another is Military, by getting places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance into the Papi≈øts hands, as who are Commanders in the la≈øt Armie but they? none more ≈øtrong in Armes, then they, to whom their Armour is delivered contrary to the Statute.

               <p>WE have of late entred into con≈øideration of the Petition of Right, and the relation of it; and upon good rea≈øon, for it concernes our goods, liberties and lives. But there is a Right of higher nature, that pre≈øerved for us farre greater things, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, our ≈øoules, yea, our God him≈øelfe; a Religion derived to us from the King of Kings, conferred to us by the Kings of this Kingdome, enacted by Lawes in this place, treading downe to us in the bloud of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and witne≈ø≈øed from Heaven by miracles, even mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous deliverances. And this Right in the name of this Nation, I this day require, and claime, that there may be a deepe and ≈øerious con≈øideration of the relations of it.</p>
               <p>I de≈øire fir≈øt, that it may be con≈øidered what new paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are layd on the old face of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to make the more lovely, and to draw ≈øo many Suitors to her.</p>
               <p>I de≈øire that it may be con≈øidered, how the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> doth eate into our Religion, and fret into he banks and walls of it, the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ≈øince the≈øe Lawes have beene made in a manner by them≈øelves, even by their owne Trea≈øons and bloudy
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:156910:266"/>de≈øignes; and ≈øince that Poperie is a con≈øu≈øed ma≈ø≈øe of errors, ca≈øting downe Kings before Popes, the Precepts of God, before the tradition of men, living, and rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, before dead and ≈øencele≈ø≈øe ≈øtocks and ≈øtones.</p>
               <p>I de≈øire that we con≈øider the encrea≈øe of Arminiani≈øme and errors, that makes the grace of God to lackie it after the will of man, that makes the Sheepe keepe the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard, and make an immortall ≈øeed, of a mortall God.</p>
               <p>Yea, I de≈øire that we looke into the very belly and bowells of this Trojan hor≈øe, to ≈øee if there be not in it men readie to open the gates of Romi≈øh tyranny, and Spani≈øh Monarchie, for an Arminian is the ≈øpaune of a Papi≈øt; and if their come the warmth of favour upon him, you ≈øhall have him turne into one of tho≈øe frogs that ari≈øe out of the bottomele≈ø≈øe pit; and if you marke it well, you ≈øhall ≈øee an Arminian reach out his hand to a Papi≈øt, to a Je≈øuite, a Je≈øuite gives one hand to the <hi>Pope,</hi> another to the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and therein ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindled a fire in our neighbors Countrey, now they have brought ≈øome of it hither, to ≈øet on flame this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome al≈øo.</p>
               <p>Let us further ≈øearch and con≈øider, whether the≈øe be not the men that breake in upon the goods and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Common-wealth, for by the≈øe meanes they may make way for the taking away of Religion. It was an old tricke of the Devills, when he meant to take away <hi>Jobs</hi> Religion, he began at his goods; <hi>Lay thy hand on all be hath, and be will cur≈øe even to thy face.</hi> Rather they thinke hereby to ≈øet a di≈øtance betweene Prince and people, or to finde ≈øome other way of ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to avoyd or breake Parliaments, that ≈øo they may break in upon our Religion, and bring in their errors: but let us doe as <hi>Job</hi> did, he held fa≈øt his Religion, and his goods were re≈øtored with advantage; and if we hold fa≈øt God, and our Religion, the≈øe things ≈øhall be unto us.</p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:156910:266"/>
               <p>Let us con≈øider the times pa≈øt, how we flouri≈øhed in honor and abundance, when Religion flouri≈øhed among≈øt us, but when Religion decayed, ≈øo the honour and ≈øtrength of our Nation decayed; when the ≈øoul of this Common-wealth is dead, the bodie cannot long over live it.

According to which, the book of Canons thus compo≈øed, was publi≈øhed in Print, the in≈øpection of the books, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, and his letters of joy for the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of the worke, and of others letters of the Prelate of <hi>London,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sterling,</hi> to the ≈øame purpo≈øe; all which
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:156910:269"/>we are readie to exhibite, will put the matter out of all debate.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides this generall, there be ≈øome things more ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worthy to be adverted unto, for di≈øcovering his ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 1. The fourth Canon of Cap. 8. for a≈ømuch as no reformation in Doctrine or Di≈øcipline can be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at once in any Church; therefore it ≈øhall, and may be lawfull fort the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> at any time to make remon≈øtrance to his M. or his ≈øucce≈ø≈øors, &amp;c. Becau≈øe this Canon holdeth the doore open to more innovations: He writeth to the Prelate of <hi>Ro≈ø≈øe</hi> his privie agent in all this worke of his great gladne≈ø≈øe, that this Canon did <hi>≈øtand bebinde the curtaine,</hi> and his great de≈øire that this Canon <hi>may be printed fully, as one that was to be mo≈øt u≈øefull.</hi> Secondly, the title prefixed to the≈øe Canons by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. Canons agreed upon to <hi>be proponed to the ≈øeverall Synods of the Kirk of Scotland;</hi> is thus changed by <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> Canons and con≈øtitutions <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall, &amp;c.</hi> Ordained to be ob≈øerved <hi>by the Clergy.</hi> He will not have Canons to come from the authority of Synods, but from the power of Prelates, or from the Kings Prerogative. Thirdly, the formidable Canon, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.3. threatning no le≈ø≈øe then excommunication again≈øt all ≈øuch per≈øons who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever ≈øhall open their mouthes again≈øt any of the≈øe bookes, proceeded not from our Prelates, nor is to be found in the copie ≈øent from them, but is a thunder bolt forged in <hi>Canterburies</hi> owne fire. 4. Our Prelates in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places witne≈ø≈øe their di≈ølike of Papi≈øts. A Mini≈øter ≈øhall be depo≈øed if he be found negligent to convert Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18.15. The adoration of the bread is a ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtition to be condemned. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.6. They call the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øitie of Bapti≈øme, an error of Popery. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.2. But in <hi>Canterburies</hi> Edition, the name of Papi≈øts and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is not ≈øo much as mentioned. 5. Our Prelates have not the boldne≈ø≈øe to trouble us in their Canons, with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Fonts, Chancells, reading of a long Liturgie before
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:156910:269"/>Sermon, &amp;c. But <hi>Canterburie</hi> is punctuall, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in all the≈øe. Although the words of the tenth Canon <hi>cap.</hi> 3. be faire, yet the wicked intentions of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and <hi>Ro≈ø≈øe,</hi> may be ≈øeen in the point of ju≈øtification of a ≈øinner before God, by comparing the Canon as it came from our Prelates, and as it was returned from <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and printed, our Prelates ≈øay thus: <hi>It is manife≈øt that the ≈øuper≈øtition of former Ages, hath turned into a great prophane≈ø≈øe, and that people are growne cold for the mo≈øt part in doing any good, thinking there is no place to good works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are excluded from ju≈øtification. Therefore ≈øhall all Mini≈øters, as their Text giveth occa≈øion, urge the nece≈ø≈øitie of good works, as they would be ≈øaved, and remember that they are</hi> via regni, <hi>the way to the Kingdome of Heaven, though not</hi> cau≈øa regnandi, <hi>howbeit they be not the cau≈øe of ≈øalvation.</hi> Here Ro≈ø≈øe giveth his judgement, <hi>That he would have this Canon, ≈øimply commanding good workes to be preached, and no mention made what place they have, or have not in ju≈øtification.</hi> Upon this motion, ≈øo agreeable to <hi>Canterburies</hi> minde, the Canon is ≈øet downe as it ≈øtandeth without the di≈øtinction of <hi>via regni,</hi> or <hi>cau≈øa regnandi,</hi> or any word ≈øounding that way, urging onely the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitie of good works. 7. By comparing Can. 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. as it was ≈øent in writing from our Prelates, and as it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Canterburies</hi> command, may be al≈øo manife≈øt, that he went about to e≈øtabli≈øh auricular confe≈ø≈øion, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh ab≈øolution. 8. Our Prelates were not acquainted with Canons, for afflicting of arbitrary penalties: But in <hi>Canterburies</hi> booke, where≈øoever there is no penalty expre≈ø≈øely ≈øet downe, it is provided that it ≈øhall be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, as the Ordinary ≈øhall thinke fitte≈øt. By the≈øe and many other the like, it is apparant, what tyrannicall power he went about to e≈øtabli≈øh in the hands of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, over the wor≈øhip, and the ≈øouls and goods of men, overturning from the foundation, the whole order of our Kirk, what ≈øeeds of Popery he did ≈øow in our Kirk,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:156910:270"/>and how large an entry he did make for the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations afterward, which hath been a main cau≈øe of all their combu≈øtion.</p>
               <p>The third and great Novation was the booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, admini≈øtration of the Sacraments, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of divine Service, brought in without warrant from our Kirk to be univer≈øally received, as the only form of divine Service, under al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By the memoirs, and in≈øtructions ≈øent unto him from our Prelates, wherein they gave a ≈øpeciall account of the diligence they had u≈øed, to do all which herein they were enjoyned, by the approbation of the Service booke ≈øent to them; and of all the marginall corrections, wherein it varieth from the Engli≈øh book, ≈øhewing their de≈øire to have ≈øome few things changed in it, which notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not granted: This we finde written by Saint <hi>Androis</hi> own hand, and ≈øub≈øcribed by him, and nine other of our Prelates.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Canterburies</hi> owne letters, witne≈ø≈øes of his joy, when the booke was readie for the Pre≈ø≈øe, of his prayers that God would ≈øpeed the worke, of the hope to ≈øee that Service ≈øet up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of his diligence to ≈øend for the Printer, and directing him to prepare a black letter, and to ≈øend it to his ≈øervants at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for printing this booke. Of his approbation of his proofes ≈øent from the Pre≈ø≈øe. Of his feare of delay, in bringing the worke ≈øpeedily to an end, for the great good, (not of that
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:156910:270"/>Church, but) of the Church Of his encouraging <hi>Ro≈ø≈øe,</hi> who was entru≈øted with the Pre≈ø≈øe, to go on in this peece of ≈øervice without feare of enemies. All which may be ≈øeen in the Autographs, and by letters ≈øent from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Ro≈ø≈øe,</hi> wherein as he rejoyceth at the ≈øight of the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Canons; which although they ≈øhould make ≈øome noi≈øe at the beginning, yet they would be more for the good of the Kirk, than the Canons of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> for the good of the Kingdom. So concerning the Leiturgy he ≈øheweth, that <hi>Ro≈ø≈øe</hi> had ≈øent to him, to have an explanation from <hi>Canterbury</hi> of ≈øome pa≈ø≈øage of the Service booke, and that the Pre≈ø≈øe behoved to ≈øtand, till the explanation come to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which therefore he had in ha≈øte obtained from his Grace, and ≈øent the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch away by <hi>Canterburies</hi> own conveyance.</p>
               <p>But the booke it ≈øelfe as it ≈øtandeth interlined, margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and patcht up, is much more than all that is expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in his letters, and the changes and ≈øupplements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves taken from the Ma≈ø≈øe-booke, and other Romi≈øh Ritualls, by which he maketh it to vary from the Booke of <hi>England,</hi> are more pregnant te≈øtimonies of his popi≈øh ≈øpirit, and wicked intentions which he would have put in execution upon us, then can be denied. The large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration profe≈ø≈øeth, that all the variation of our booke, from the booke of <hi>England,</hi> that ever the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, was in ≈øuch things as the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> humour would better comply with, than with that which ≈øtood in the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Service. The≈øe popi≈øh innovations therefore have been ≈øurreptitiou≈øly in≈øerted by him, without the Kings knowledge, and again≈øt his purpo≈øe. Our <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh</hi> Prelates do petition that ≈øomething may be abated of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ceremonies, as the Cro≈ø≈øe in Bapti≈øme, the Ring in Marriage, and ≈øome other things. But <hi>Canterbury</hi> will not only have the≈øe kept, but a great many more, and wor≈øe ≈øuperadded, which was nothing el≈øe, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of fewell to the fire. To expre≈ø≈øe and di≈øcover all,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:156910:271"/>would require a whole booke, we ≈øhall only touch ≈øome few in the matter of the Communion.</p>
               <p>This book inverteth the ordor of the Communion in the book of <hi>England,</hi> as may be ≈øeen by the numbers, ≈øetting down the orders of this new Communion, 1.5.2.6.7.3.4.8.9.10.15. Of the divers ≈øecret rea≈øons of this change, we mention one only; in joyning the ≈øpirituall prai≈øe and thank≈øgiving, which is in the book of <hi>England,</hi> pertinently after the Communion, with the prayer of Con≈øecration before the Communion, and that under the name of memorable or oblation, for no other end, but that the memoriall and ≈øacrifice of prai≈øe, mentioned in it, may be under≈øtood according to the popi≈øh meaning. <hi>Bellar. de Mi≈ø≈øae, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. Not of the ≈øpirituall ≈øacrifice, but of the oblation of the body of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It ≈øeemeth to be no great matter, that without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the book of <hi>England,</hi> the Presbter going from the North end of the Tabls, ≈øhall ≈øtand during the time of Con≈øecration, at ≈øuch a part of the Table, where he may with the more ea≈øe and decencie u≈øe both hands; yet being tryed; it importeth much, as that he mu≈øt ≈øtand with his hinder parts to the people, repre≈øenting (≈øayth <hi>Durand</hi>) that which the Lord ≈øayd of <hi>Mo≈øes, Thou ≈øhalt ≈øee my hinder parts.</hi> He mu≈øt have the u≈øe of both his hands, not for any thing he hath to do about the bread and wine, for that may be done at the North end of the Table, and be better ≈øeen of the people; but (as we are taught by the Rationali≈øts) that he may be ≈øtretching forth his arms, to repre≈øent the exten≈øion of Chri≈øt on the Cro≈ø≈øe, and that he may the more conveniently lift up the bread and wine above his head to be ≈øeen and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the people, who in the Rubrick of the generall Confe≈ø≈øion, a little before, are directed to kneel humbly on their knees, that the Prie≈øts elevation ≈øo magnified in the Ma≈ø≈øe, and the peoples adoration may go together; That in this po≈øture, ≈øpeaking with a low voyce, and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:156910:271"/>muttering (for ≈øometimes he is commanded to ≈øpeak with a lowd voyce, and di≈øtinctly) he be not heard by the people; which is no le≈ø≈øe a mocking of God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then if the words were ≈øpoken in an unknown lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. As there is no word of all this in the Engli≈øh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ≈øo doth the booke in King <hi>Ed.</hi> time, give to every Presbyter his liberty of ge≈øture, which yet gave ≈øuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to <hi>Bucer,</hi> (the cen≈øurer of the book: and even in <hi>Ca≈ø≈øanders</hi> own judgement, a man of great moderation in matters of this kinde) that he calleth them, <hi>Nunquam ≈øatis execrandos Mi≈ø≈øe ge≈øtus,</hi> and would have them to be abhorred, becau≈øe they confirm to the ≈øimple and ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitious <hi>ter impiam &amp; exitialem Mi≈ø≈øe fiduciam.</hi>

               <p>The change here is made the worke of Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie: the words of the Ma≈ø≈øe, <hi>ut fiant nobis,</hi> are tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in King <hi>Edwards</hi> booke, <hi>That they may be unto us,</hi> which are againe turned into Latine by <hi>Ale≈øius, ut fiant nohis.</hi> On the other part, the expre≈ø≈øions of the booke of <hi>England</hi> at the delivery of the Elements of <hi>feeding on Chri≈øt by faith,</hi> and of <hi>eating and drinking in remembrance that Chri≈øt dyed for thee,</hi> are utterly deleated. Many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences there be in this part of the Communion, of the bodily pre≈øence of Chri≈øt, very agreeable to the doctrines taught by his Secretaries, which this paper cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.

               <p>We do indeed confe≈ø≈øe that the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> have been of very different humors, ≈øome of them of a more hot, and others of them, men of a more moderate temper, ≈øome of them more, and ≈øome of them le≈ø≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Poperie, yet what knowne truth, and con≈øtant experience hath made undeniable, we mu≈øt at this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie profe≈ø≈øe, that from the fir≈øt time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not only after the comming of King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory into <hi>England,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prelates of <hi>England,</hi> have been by all means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øantly working the overthrow of our Di≈øcipline and Government.

               </p>

               <p>When he found that the Reformation begun in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did ≈øtand in his way, he left no means una≈ø≈øaied to rub di≈øgrace upon us, and our cau≈øe.

               <p>When the Nationall Oath and Covenant warranted by our generall A≈ø≈øemblies, was approved by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Articles ≈øub≈øcribed in the Kings name, by his Maie≈øties high Commi≈ø≈øioner, and by the Lords of privie Coun≈øell, and Commanded to be ≈øworn by his Maje≈øties Subiects of all ranks; and particular and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary information was given unto the Lievetenant, by men of ≈øuch quality as he ought to have believed, of the loyalty of our hears to the King, of the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of our proceedings, and innocency of our Covenant, and whole cour≈øe, that he could have no excu≈øe: yet his de≈øperate malice made him to bend his craft and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:156910:275"/>cruelty, his fraud and forces again≈øt us. For fir≈øt, he did craftily call up to <hi>Dublin</hi> ≈øome of our Country-men both of the Nobility and Gentry, living in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ≈øhewing them, that the King would conceive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them as Con≈øpirers with the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious cour≈øes, except ≈øome remedie were provided; and for remedy, ≈øugge≈øting his own wicked invention, to pre≈øent unto him and his own wicked Councell, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which he cau≈øed to be framed by the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Raphoe,</hi> and was ≈øeen and corrected by him≈øelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they petitioned to have an oath given them, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a formall renunciation of the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Covenant, and a deep a≈ø≈øurance never ≈øo much as to prote≈øt again≈øt any of his Maje≈øties commandements what≈øoever.</p>
               <p>No ≈øooner was this Oath thus craftily contriv'd, but in all ha≈øte it is ≈øent to ≈øuch places of the Kingdome where our Countrey-men had re≈øidence; and men, women, and all other per≈øons above the years of ≈øixteen, con≈øtrained either pre≈øently to take the Oath, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by renounce their Nationall Covenant as ≈øeditious and trayterous, or with violence and cruelty to be haled to the Jayle, fined above the valew of their e≈øtates, and to be kept clo≈øe pri≈øoners, and ≈øo farre as we know, ≈øome are yet kept in pri≈øon, both men and women of good quality, for not renouncing that Oath which they had taken forty years ≈øince, in obedience to the King who then lived.

And ≈øome indited and declared guilty of high-trea≈øon, for no
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:156910:276"/>other guiltine≈ø≈øe but for ≈øub≈øcribing our National oath, which was not only impiety and inju≈øtice in it ≈øelf, and an utter undoing of his Maje≈øties Subiects, but was a weakning of the <hi>Scots</hi> Plantation, to the prejudice of that Kingdome, and his Maje≈øties ≈øervice, and was a high ≈øcandall again≈øt the Kings honour, and intolerable abu≈øe to his Maje≈øties tru≈øt and authority: his Maje≈øties Commi≈ø≈øion, which was procured by the Lievetenant, bearing no other penalty then a certification of noting the names of the refu≈øers of the oath.</p>
               <p>But by this his re≈øtle≈ø≈øe rage and in≈øatiable cruelty, again≈øt our Religion and Countrey, cannot be kept within the bounds of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this means a Parliament is called, And although by the ≈øix ≈øub≈øidies granted in Parliament not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and by the ba≈øe means which him≈øelf and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did u≈øe, as is contained in a late Remon≈øtrance, that Land was extreamly impoveri≈øhed, yet by his ≈øpeeches full of oathes and a≈ø≈øeverations, <hi>That we were Traytors and Rebels, ca≈øting off all Monarchicall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> he extorted from them foure new Sub≈øidies, and <hi>indicta cau≈øa</hi> before we were heard, procured that a Warre was udertaken, and forces ≈øhould be levied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us, as a rebellious Nation, which was al≈øo inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be an example and pre≈øident to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> for granting ≈øub≈øidies, and ≈øending a joynt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie for our utter ruine.</p>
               <p>According to his appointment in Parliament, the Armie was gathered, and brought down to the Coa≈øt, threatning a daily inva≈øion of our Countrey, intending to make us a conquered Province, and to de≈øtroy our Religion, liberties, and Lawes, and thereby laying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us a nece≈ø≈øity of va≈øt charges, to keep forces on foot on the We≈øt coa≈øt to wait upon his comming.</p>
               <p>And as the War was denounced, and forces leavied before we were heard. So before the denouncing of the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:156910:276"/>War, our Ships, and goods on the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Coa≈øt were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the owners ca≈øt in pri≈øon, and ≈øome of them in Irons. Frigats were ≈øent forth to ≈øcour our Coa≈øts, which did take ≈øome, and burn others of our Barques.</p>
               <p>Having thus incited the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and put his forces in order there again≈øt us, with all ha≈øte he commeth to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his parting, at the giving up of the Sword, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly avowed our utter ruine and de≈øolation, in the≈øe or the like words, If I <hi>returne to that honourable Sword,</hi> I <hi>≈øhall leave of the</hi> Scots <hi>neither root nor branch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ≈øoon he commeth to Court, as before he had done very evill offices again≈øt our Commi≈ø≈øioners, cleering our proceedings before the poynt: So now hou≈øeth all means to ≈øtir up the King and Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us, and to move them to a pre≈øent war, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the precedent, and example of his own making in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And finding that his hopes failed him, and his de≈øignes ≈øucceeded not that way, in his nimblene≈ø≈øe he taketh another cour≈øe, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may be broken up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øing their wi≈øedome and authority, not onely with great gladne≈ø≈øe accepteth, but u≈øeth all means that the conduct of the Army in the expedition again≈øt <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be put upon him; which accordingly he obtaineth as generall Captain, with power to invade, kill, ≈ølay, and ≈øave at his di≈øcretion, and to make any one, or moe Deputies in his ≈øtead, to do, and execute all the power and authorities committed to him.</p>
               <p>According to the largene≈ø≈øe of his Commi≈ø≈øion, and Letters Patents of his devi≈øing, ≈øo were his deportments afterwards; for when the <hi>Scots,</hi> according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations ≈øent before them, were comming in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, far from any intention to invade any of his Maje≈øties Subiects, and ≈øtill to ≈øupplicate his Maje≈øty for a ≈øetled peace, he gave order to his Officers to fight
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:156910:277"/>with them on the way, that the two Nations once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in bloud, what≈øoever ≈øhould be the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, he might e≈øcape triall and cen≈øure, and his bloudy de≈øigns might be put in execution again≈øt his Maie≈øties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of both Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>When the Kings Maie≈øty was again enclined to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to our petitions, and to compo≈øe our differences in a peaceable way, and the Peers of <hi>England</hi> conveened at <hi>Yorke,</hi> had, as before, in their great wi≈øedome and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe given unto his Maie≈øties Coun≈øels of peace, yet this firebrand ≈øtill ≈ømoaketh; and in that honorable A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, taketh upon him to breath out threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us as Traytors, and enemies to Monarchiall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that we be ≈øent home again in our bloud, and he will whip us out of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the≈øe were his ≈øpeeches in the time of the Treaty appointed by his Maie≈øty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> that if it had been po≈ø≈øible, it might have been broken up. So when a Ce≈ø≈øation of Arms was happily agreed upon there, yet he cea≈øeth not, but ≈øtill his practi≈øes were for war; His under officers can tell who it was that gave them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to draw near in Arms beyond the <hi>Tee≈øe,</hi> in the time of the Treaty at <hi>Rippon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour of <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi> can ≈øhew, from whom they had their warrants for their Acts of ho≈øtility after the ce≈ø≈øation was concluded.

               <p>We therefore de≈øire that your Lord≈øhips will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to the Parliament, that this great incendiary upon the≈øe and the like offences, not again≈øt particular per≈øons, but again≈øt Kingdomes, and Nations, may be put to a tryall, and from their knowne and renowned ju≈øtice, may have his de≈øerved puni≈øhment.</p>

               <p>Our earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe in following this our Demand, doth not ≈øo far wrong our fight, and make us ≈øo undi≈øcerning, as not to make a difference between the Kingdome and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which did neither di≈øcerne nor ≈øet forward a Warre again≈øt us; And that prevalent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Prelates and Papi≈øts who have moved every ≈øtone again≈øt us, and u≈øed all ≈øorts of means, not onely their Coun≈øells, Sub≈øidies, and Forces, but their Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Prayers, for our utter ruine; which maketh them obnoxious to our ju≈øt accu≈øations, and guilty of all the lo≈ø≈øes and wrongs which this time pa≈øt we have ≈øu≈øtained: Yet this we de≈øire your Lord≈øhips to con≈øider, That the States of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> being a≈ø≈øembled, did endeavour by their Declarations, Informations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrances, and by the proceedings of their Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, to make known unto the Councell, Kingdome, and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and to forewarn them of the mi≈øchief intended again≈øt both Kingdomes, in their Religion and Liberties, by the Prelates and papi≈øts, to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:156910:279"/>the end that our Inva≈øion from <hi>England</hi> might have been prevented, if by the prevalency of the faction it had been po≈ø≈øible. And therefore we may now with the greater rea≈øon and confidence pre≈ø≈øe our Demand; that your Lord≈øhips, the Parliament, the Kingdome, and the King him≈øelf, may ≈øee us repaired in our lo≈ø≈øes, at the co≈øt of that faction by who≈øe means we have ≈øu≈øtained ≈øo much dammage; And which, except they repent, we finde ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row recompenced for our grief, torments for our toyl, and an infinite greater lo≈ø≈øe for the Temporall lo≈ø≈øes, they have brought upon a whole Kingdome, which was dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by them in peace.</p>
               <p>All the devices and doings of our common enemies, were to bear down the truth of Religion, and the ju≈øt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects in both Kingdomes. They were confident to bring this about one of two wayes: Either by blocking us up by Sea and Land, to con≈øtrain us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their will for a law both in Church and Policy, and thus to make us a precedent for the like mi≈øery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or by their Inva≈øion of our Kingdome, to compell us furiou≈øly, and without order, to break into <hi>England;</hi> That the two Nations once entred into a bloody Warre, they might fi≈øh in our troubled waters, and catch their de≈øired prey. But as we declared before our coming: We tru≈øted that God would turn their wi≈øedome into fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and bring their devices upon their own pares, by our Intentions and Re≈øolutions to come into <hi>England,</hi> as among our Brethren, in the mo≈øt peaceable way that could ≈øtand with our ≈øafety, in re≈øpect of our common enemies, to pre≈øent our petitions for ≈øetling our peace, by a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> wherein the intentions and actions, both of our adver≈øaries and ours, might be brought to light; The Kings Maje≈øty and the Kingdome right informed, The Authors and In≈øtruments of our divi≈øions and troubles puni≈øhed, All the mi≈øchiefs of a Nationall and doubtfull warre prevented, and Religion
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:156910:279"/>and Liberty with greater peace and amity than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore e≈øtabli≈øhed, again≈øt all the craft and violence of our enemies. This was our Declaration before we ≈øet our <hi>England,</hi> from which our deportments ≈øince have not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And it hath been the Lords wonderfull doing, by the wi≈øe coun≈øels, and ju≈øt proceedings of the Parliament, to bring it in a great part to pa≈ø≈øe, and to give us lively hopes of a happy conclu≈øion: And therefore we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubt, but that the Parliament in their wi≈øedom and iu≈øtice, will provide that a proportionable part of the co≈øt and charges of a work ≈øo great and ≈øo comfortable to both Nations be born by the Delinquents there, that with the better con≈øcience the good people of <hi>England</hi> may ≈øit under their own Vines and Fig-trees, refre≈øhing them≈øelves, although upon our great pains and hazard, yet not altogether upon our co≈øt and charges, which we are not able to bear.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> doth know and confe≈ø≈øe that the innovation of religion and liberties in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were not the principall de≈øigne of our common enemies, but that both in the intention of the workers, who≈øe zeal was hotte≈øt for ≈øetling their devices at home: and in the condition ≈øo the work, making us whom they conceived to be the weaker for oppo≈øition to be nothing el≈øe but a leading ca≈øe for <hi>England.</hi> And that although by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, which is made perfect in weakne≈ø≈øe, they have found among≈øt us greater re≈øi≈øtance than they did fear, or either they or our ≈øelves could have apprehended; Yet as it hath been the will of God that we ≈øhould endure the heat of the day, ≈øo in the evening the precious wages of the vindication of religion, liberties, and laws are to be received by both Kingdoms, and will enrich, we hope, to our un≈øpeakable ioy, the pre≈øent age, and the po≈øterity with ble≈ø≈øings that cannot be valued, and with the good people of <hi>England,</hi> e≈øteem more than trea≈øures of Gold, and willingly would have puacha≈øed with many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands.
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:156910:280"/>We do not plead that con≈øcience and piety have moved ≈øome men to ≈øerve God upon their own co≈øt, and that ju≈øtice and equity have directed others, where the harve≈øt hath been common to con≈øider the pains of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the charges of the ≈øowing, yet thus much may we ≈øay, that had a forraigne enemy, intending to reduce the whole I≈øland into Popery, made the fir≈øt a≈ø≈øault upon her weakne≈ø≈øe, we nothing doubt but the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> from their de≈øire to pre≈øerve their Religion and liberties, would have found the way to bear with us the expence of our re≈øi≈øtance and lawfull defence, how much more being invaded, although not by <hi>England,</hi> yet from <hi>England,</hi> by common enemies, ≈øeeking the ≈øame ends, we expect to be helped and relieved.</p>
               <p>We will never conceive that it is either the will or the weal and honour of <hi>England,</hi> that we ≈øhould go from ≈øo ble≈ø≈øed a work; after ≈øo many grievous ≈øufferings, bearing on our backs the in≈øupportable burdens of worldly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, return to our Country empty, and exhau≈øted, in which the people of all ranks, ≈øexes, and conditions, have ≈øpent them≈øelves. The po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man who devoted him≈øelf heartily to this cau≈øe, are burdened, not onely with his own per≈øonall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar expence, but with the publike and common charges; of which if there be no relief, neither can our Kingdom have peace at home, nor any more credit for Commerce abroad: Nor will it be po≈ø≈øible for us, either to aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt our friends, or to re≈øi≈øt and oppo≈øe the re≈øtle≈ø≈øe and working wickedne≈ø≈øe of our enemies: The be≈øt ≈øort will lo≈øe much of the ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of the enjoying of their religion and liberties, and others will run ≈øuch wayes, and undirect cour≈øes as their de≈øperate nece≈ø≈øity will drive them into. We ≈øhall be but a burthen to our ≈øelves, a vexation unto others, of who≈øe ≈øtrength we de≈øire to be a con≈øiderable part, and a fit ≈øubject for our enemies to work upon for obtaining their now di≈øappointed, but never dying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires.</p>
